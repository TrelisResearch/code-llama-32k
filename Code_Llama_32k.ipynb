            "we are here live in Omaha Nebraska good morning everybody I'm Becky quick\\nalong with Mike santoli and in just 30 minutes time Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO Warren Buffett's going to be\\ntaking the stage with his vice chair Charlie Munger the legendary duo will also be joined by berkshire's two other\\nVice chairs Greg Abel who manages the non-insurance operations for the company and Ajit Jain who runs all of the\\ninsurance businesses and as always it's pretty big crowd here lots and lots of people and a few people you might notice\\ntoo Tim Cook is here Apple of course is still berkshire's largest holding big big part of its portfolio there you see\\nhim backstage getting ready to go out and take his seat he gets to sit down in the special seats by the way that's\\nDebbie pasonic Warren's assistant who's standing by just went bite beside him also in the crowd Bill Murray he has\\nbeen here for a couple of days been hanging around you can check out he is taking a seat right now too some other\\nbig people who are expected to be here some well-known names Jane Frazier who's the city CEO Ruth parat of alphabet\\nshe's actually here I did and see her a little earlier and by the way this was a scene just a short time ago as the\\nBerkshire shareholders who were first in line started streaming onto the floor Mike this is like um Black Friday used\\nto be yeah day after Thanksgiving people waiting lining up these were the doors\\num yeah it was a big rush they opened and everybody comes running in and it's not just because of the rain outside absolutely if it's a massive Arena\\nConvention Center so people know and uh I don't know what time do they start lining up I looked out the window at 5\\n30 and I thought huh that's not as big of a crowd as I've seen in years past but then I realized it's because they\\nchanged the setup for this people used to stand about 10 Deep right at the door this year they pushed everybody the\\ncrowds down the the block because they I guess they didn't want too much of a mob scene in one place if you watched it\\nwent for blocks I didn't realize it till I went to the other side of the hotel to see it went for blocks and blocks and I've honestly never seen a line this\\nlong a lot of people around the convention center talking about how it's it's buzzier and more crowded in the\\nexhibit all this year versus last year which was the first after the pandemic of course they broke for two years so it\\nseems like there is a little more of a interest in uh in being here in person well they know how to time it there's a lot of news that's happening um usually\\nyou get about 40 000 people who are here this year they've been running ahead just in terms of the number of tickets\\nthat they gave out and I talked to Warren Buffett briefly last night he said that they had 6 000 people who\\nshowed up at will call yesterday to try and get last minute tickets they ran out of tickets they had to go print more to\\ntry and get people in the doors and they've never seen anything like that and as you mentioned the stuff sold out\\nif you if you look at some of the places that are back here we're going to talk about some of these companies but he's been running the numbers and seeing what\\nhappened I I won't say too much now but he's been tabulating all of this up to see exactly what their sales are running\\nlike here versus uh years fast obviously this is sort of a weird microcosm of the\\nof the business in the company as a whole and it's uh it's it's not Revenue neutral as he always talks about it\\nlooks you're paying you're paying to play here you are in fact it is going to be a big day here first though we should\\ntalk about the news at hand Berkshire is out with first quarter earnings and that came just moments ago Mike has been\\ndigging through all the numbers on this and there's some stories to be told here there are first of all a big swing to the upside in the overall reported\\nearnings number uh from about five and a half billion uh dollars in the first quarter last year to 35 and a half\\nbillion but almost all that swing was the The Mark to Market on the Investment Portfolio operating earnings though is\\nstill a good story up almost 13 percent you know over a year up to about a little more than eight billion dollars\\num it seems like the insurance business specifically Geico swinging to a fatter\\nunderwriting profit from last year we could talk about exactly how they got there but it seems as if higher pricing\\nless advertising Revenue they they went from margin as opposed to Pure market share it seems at this point also on the\\ninvestment side uh seems like there was a reduction in the Chevron stake uh over\\nthe course of the quarter you have to back into the numbers based on the dollar value of the stakes that they give you in the share prices at the time\\nbut essentially it seems like he Berkshire was a seller of about 20 percent of that stake it's like oh\\nthat's a big six or seven billion uh dollars worth okay and um so it's still a significant holding I think it's also\\nkeep worth keeping in mind Chevron stock was up over 50 last year so simply by the market appreciating the the dollar\\nvalue went up fair bit well it's interesting though if they were selling some of that steak while they were building the oxy stake uh the accident\\npetroleum stake um not a call necessarily on oil overall just maybe\\npicking exactly relative value or or positioning uh within that uh also\\nBerkshire a net seller of overall Equity uh Securities in the quarter but the\\nmajority of that net reduction seems to be the Chevron I think the rest of it's hard to know Apple pretty much unchanged\\nof course the Stock's up a lot but the position is unchanged uh Bank of America also seems unchanged too so those are\\ntwo not a lot of change in terms of the key core holder for Bank of America that's the one bank that he has kept he\\nsold out of a handful of other Banks Banks some of them that he's held for a very long time so Bank of America still\\nseems to be his favorite maybe we'll hear more about that today you would hope yeah and just maybe General thoughts about his assessment of the\\nbanking system and uh whether it needs help whether it looks like it's an opportunity you have all these\\nvaluations that have been crushed another thing to keep in mind uh for the quarter there was four and a half\\nbillion dollars of shares bought back by Berkshire so that was up from 3.2\\nbillion in the year ago quarter it's not an enormous number in terms of the market value of Berkshire which is 700\\nbillion dollars it's like a you know what 18 billion dollar annual run rate of share buyback but they do reduce the\\noutstanding shares a net reduction of shares down about 1.2 percent uh year over year so you know there were\\nquestions that came in that I've been looking through shareholder questions for a couple of months now that have been coming in on this and some of the\\nquestions that came in is do you still like Berkshire Hathaway do you still like the stock at this price are you\\ngoing to be as aggressive as a buyer and I guess this answers some of that question some of it yeah it's it's absolutely not super aggressive uh but\\nit's it's it's sort of soaking up some of the shares that are out there and of course Buffett in his shareholder letter\\nwas very vociferous about defending the practice of of being able to buy back\\nstocks so he does it in a disciplined way he wants to be careful about why he's doing it and what the valuation is\\nbut uh clearly he's willing to use that tool oh the cash went up to 130 billion\\ndollars so up marginally total cash holder nice Pocket Change um there had been a lot of questions\\nthat came into about the insurance company specifically Geico and you can see the gecko right now that's right shoulder uh people just wondering um\\nwhat's happening and I guess we'll dig into that a little deeper today and we've got some numbers that you've been going through be very interested to hear\\nthe color on the strategy behind it because there was a little bit of uh you know an issue last year where it seemed\\nlike profitability was done now pricing is up across the industry yeah so policies are able to be written at\\nhigher prices and so that's happening across the board but it does seem you know as I say in the commentary within the the 10q that they did reduce\\nadvertising expense and it was a big swing to the upside and underwriting earnings I mean with insurance it takes\\na while to raise pricing for anybody in the industry because you have to go state by state and get Regulators approvals before approvals before you\\ncan actually raise any of it so there is a delay we saw some a huge hit to the profitability of all the insurers as you\\nknow prices to replace cars prices to fix things construction all of that went up right and they couldn't raise their prices as quickly exactly so it is an\\nindustry-wide phenomena but it seems as if uh Geico is trying to decide they want to skew toward more profitable\\ncustomers we'll see if that's a theme that's going to continue another couple of tidbits are building products and\\nconsumers margin squeeze that's happening across the industry railroads pretty flat okay the BNSF pretty flat\\nyear over year and a pretty big reduction in consumer related Freight uh loading who needs an analyst you've\\nalready done all the work wow did the highlights I got my little you know tape bookmarks yeah that's good it works okay\\nwe have a lot more to get to this morning we want to give you a quick look at today's schedule though Mike and I are going to be here with you until 10\\n15 a.m eastern time that is when Buffett Munger and the vice chairman Greg Abel and Ajit Jane are going to be taking the\\nstage you get to watch all of this the annual meeting you can see it exclusively here on CNBC and cnbc.com\\nBuffett's going to begin the meeting with the summary of the past quarters results but like we said Mike's already\\ndone that for you so that's your bathroom break time then he's going to open the stage to shareholder questions\\nand I'll be asking some that have been emailed into me again we've gotten lots and lots of emails this year more than\\nI've ever seen Buffett's also going to rotate through the 11 microphone microphone positions that are in the\\naudience too so you'll see a lot of questions being asked around 1pm Buffett will break for lunch but you get to\\nstick around with us Mike and I will be joined right here by Berkshire board members Ron Olson and Howard Buffett we'll also be talking to Tech investor\\nAnn widblad and Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby kodek who has been coming to this meeting for years he was here last year\\nbut had to leave early because he was going to a birthday party so he left I think at the lunch break after that is\\nwhen Buffett revealed to the crowd that he had taken a stake in Activision Blizzard so Bobby found out when he was\\non a plane on his way back home so he's here this year too and we'll find out if there's any new news on that at the time\\nof course it was viewed as an Arbitrage position because Activision agreed to be sold to Microsoft for cash and Buffett\\nsaid it was an Arbitrage position yeah exactly the spread was very wide it seemed just like the market was leaving money on the table now that it looks\\nlike perhaps Regulators in the UK might block that deal the question is does it remain you know on a fundamental basis\\nyeah that would be fascinating to hear the commentary on that and then at 2 p.m Eastern Buffett and Munger will be back\\non stage for another two and a half hours of shareholder q a after the afternoon session wraps we'll be back\\nwith you to recap all of the day's action while the Market's staging a big rally\\nto close the week after a strong job support and revisions to the February and March employment numbers Apple a\\nmajor Berkshire holding which was unchanged in the quarter a key driver for yesterday's rally the stock closing\\nHigher by about four and a half percent uh on the day after posting better than expected earnings Apple now up nearly 34\\npercent so far this year here to help us navigate the current market environment and look at opportunities right now as\\nJohn Rogers he's the chairman and co-ceo of aerial Investments and a long time Berkshire meeting attendee John good to\\nsee you thanks for stopping by here great to be here um what's your uh I guess what you what are you looking to hear from Mr Buffett\\nand Munger uh both about I mean we know that the principles are going to accentuate that they always do about how\\nthey do their business and and what matters and doesn't matter in the uh in the earnings and how they approach things but what about the moment right\\nnow where it seems like there's big big questions about financial system stability whether there's value in in\\nBank stocks whether the economy can handle these rate hikes a couple things that I'm going to be looking for one you\\nknow when Becky interviewed Warren when he was in Asia and there was talk and Warren talked about how certain of his\\ncompanies were not meeting expectations earnings were going to be less than expected and profits were lower than expected and so I want to see if that\\ntrend has continued are is he still seeing weakness in the overall economy and the second thing you know Becky\\nfollowed up the question about Paramount Global and he was kind of a little bit soft and not as aggressively supporting\\nhis position as I had expected so I'm curious to see what he has to say today about it especially after the stock just\\nlocated this week and you are an owner of Paramount correct we are an owner of Paramount Global assist it's not been a\\nfun week yeah how do you feel about things I mean Paramount slashing the dividend um I I think it caught some people by\\nsurprise but Mario gabelli was here yesterday and he said it didn't catch him by surprise he wanted them to do that because he wanted them to shore up\\ntheir cast position and put it back into their business at this point but I think it was the right decision and I watched\\nMario yesterday morning and then we did a panel and he has been very positive about the future\\nfor Paramount Global so we're still very very optimistic we think they have so many assets around the world they've got\\nthat great Paramount Library they've got Mission Impossible coming out this year all the great Sports entertainment that\\nthey have and all-time favorites like 60 minutes so I think there's more there than just the streaming and I think\\nsometimes people are more worried than they need to be is it more there as a standalone business or do you think that this is an acquisition an acquisition\\nTarget and that I mean Mario belly has always been about you know business of Love Making with mergers and\\nacquisitions you're right I think that everyone as we talk to experts in in the industry everyone says there's way too many\\nstreaming services we've got to get it down to three four at the maximum so I think it's very possible that Paramount\\nGlobal will be bought at some point as a value manager do you look at the Carnage\\nin things like Regional Banks and anything that seems like it's it's connected to a commercial real estate and view that as uh more of a core risk\\nto the economic Outlook or is there actual value being being surfaced in the process well I think the stocks have\\ngotten crushed there's a lot of pessimism and Warren often says you want to be greedy when others are fearful so I think if you're going to buy the\\nbanking stocks you'd buy a whole basket of them not try to pick one but really be Diversified we've been also adding to\\nour favorite Northern Trust is our favorite Bank stock so I I think we're going to be okay uh it's going to be\\nsome pain and anguish here and of course commercial real estate is getting harmed and it doesn't help having the banks and\\nthe problems they are but yeah down the road we'll be fine I've been talking to folks who here in the last day and there is a little bit of suspense as to\\nwhether in fact clearly we'll get some questions on this whether uh Buffett himself sees there to be any\\nopportunities here to provide capital in areas where it's like I mean it's worth going back to how he acquired a lot of\\nhis financial positions right American Express 60 years ago coming off a crisis that he needed Capital Bank of America\\nclearly Solomon Brothers in the early 90s uh Goldman Sachs back around the crisis too so in other words he's been\\nthere as a source of stable Capital at times when the financial system seemed like it was in trouble would you want to\\nsee him make a move like that that would bring a lot of confidence to the economy and to the financial system whenever he\\nsteps up all of us believe in him so much so I think it would be great if he was able to be helpful during this\\nperiod and get a great return for Berkshire shareholders\\ninvolved with conversations on these things are there deals that he saw and passed up on you know maybe we'll get a\\nlittle color into some of that today I'm hoping that you know maybe that's why there's so many people that are here\\ntoday too John we're going to welcome our television audience in in just a second but we want you to stay with us\\nand I'm doing this because literally the TV clicked so I'm just hold your thought for just a second we want to make sure\\nwe are welcoming our audience in fact you're going to hear a bell in just a second yeah ding ding ding there it goes that\\nsound that you're hearing right now me doing ding ding ding it means that it's 10 a.m eastern time and that means that\\nit is time to welcome our television audience as well we are again at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting and uh\\nyeah okay want to welcome our television audience here and around the world I'm Becky quick I'm here with Mike santoli\\nand this is our live all-day coverage of the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting we are just 15 minutes away from\\nthe start of the action I want to get back to our conversation with John Rogers he's the chairman the co-ceo and\\nthe co and the CIO of aerial Investments and for everybody on television this is a conversation we've been having with\\nour streaming audience at cnbc.com so let's just pick it up with where we left off John you were just talking about how if you saw Buffett step in and do some\\nsort of a deal whether it be in the banking system whether it be something that kind of showed some confidence in\\nthe system that would mean a big deal for investors everywhere I think it would be he is so revered as we know\\naround the world and I know that the by the Administration has been talking with him and I know you know other leaders\\nare and you can bet that he's the First Call of Many of the major banking Giants on Wall Street to make sure they're\\ngetting his best advice and including him in these important conversations it's probably also worth keeping in mind that what he says about his take on\\nwhether in fact the banking system is sound whether whether the market is over\\novershooting and it's uh attack on some of these Regional Bank valuations it's worth listening to as well if he thinks\\nthe FED has it right we have this deposit backstop facility and you know let's keep in mind one of the reasons\\nthat the bank stocks are going down is consumers are in great shape they got a lot of cheap mortgages unprofitable for\\nthe banks they're looking at five percent money market yields they can move their cash there so it's it's it'll\\nbe interesting to hear whether he thinks it's an economic risk or it's just kind of a sector that's upside down for the\\nmoment well as you know he's such a long-term investor and I think he's going to uh you believe as he always\\ntalks about on at the annual meeting about how last century all the problems that confronted our country we always\\nresolve him our capitalist democracy is the best system ever invented so this crisis will pass also I also noticed\\nwhen I love watching CNBC in the morning when you have those special boxes showing returns like now even showing them Regional Banks how they're doing\\nthat's a sign that you're getting toward a period where you know six months from now that'll be a old forgotten story and\\nwe'll be on to something new but I love seeing that because it gives you a sense of what's important today John you our\\nlong-term investor too you're a value investor you don't often get swayed by things that are happening in the\\nimmediate but I have to think that some of the things you've seen recently have been enough to make you sit up and take\\nnotice is there anything you've changed in the portfolio as a result of the potential credit crunch as the result of\\njust watching money move quickly out of places does it change your mind or change your investors thesis at all for\\nthe short term the only thing that sometimes happens like right now the housing the markets have been very weak higher interest rates have been\\nTroublesome and problematic for the Housing Industry so we've been leaning in in some of the suppliers to the\\nHousing Industry some of our favorites like Leslie's pools for example and residio and people that are creating\\nproducts for the Housing Industry we think it's been overdone and there's real Bargains there you know there's been a lot of commentary and to some\\ndegree a bit of angst about how uh narrow the index performance has been at\\nleast recently for times this year we talked about Apple's performance a huge sway on the index is a handful of stocks\\nreally carrying the S P 500 where does that leave you as somebody who looks you know for smaller and and less expensive\\nless popular stocks at the moment you know you know I've been fishing in the small and mid-cap Value World for 40\\nyears and I really think there's more opportunity than ever there's these orphan stocks neglected stocks and no\\none's looking at because they've been so focused on these giant great giant companies that have done so well\\nwhat about Berkshire itself in terms of How It's positioned I mean on the one hand it's kind of Eternal right the way\\nit's structured and who it's managed by but on the other I mean if you look at what's in favor right now you know aside\\nfrom Apple which is you know 20 of the market value of Berkshire right now uh it's taken it is uh you have you know\\nConsumer Staples exposure you have real Capital assets that people seem to be wanting to have pricing power\\num and even on the insurance side they're able to actually make a profit interest rates being up perhaps a help to them do you see value in the shares\\nthemselves at this level we do you know when Warren makes the decision to buy back stock the way he has he's so\\nconservative and so for him to make that bet it gives you a really great sense that he sees the company as really\\nundervalued and we would agree we think it's a great bargain here today do you have you been buying I own it\\npersonally and I was too big for my small and mid cap value uh portfolios at aerial fund but uh I haven't added to it\\nin a while but that's a good suggestion John thank you very much we always enjoy\\nseeing you here and we really appreciate your time this morning John Rogers from aerial Investments\\nall right Berkshire Hathaways 11.6 billion dollar acquisition a year ago of the property and casually ensure\\nAllegheny brought another diverse portfolio of Brands Under The Berkshire umbrella including one of the fastest\\ngrowing toy makers in the U.S that's Jazz Wares they make all those viral squishmallows and here at the meeting\\nthey're actually selling special Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger squish millos this weekend they come in eight inch\\nsize and 16 inch versions this is the first time they've ever made squishmallows with a real human space on\\nthem we actually caught up with the company CEO and chief commercial officer Judd and Laura zaberski\\nwe acquired a company called kelly toys okay and they were making squish Mallows it's been around since 2017 and we were\\nfortunate enough to build the brand once we acquired Kelly toys because the I mean people compare this to things like\\nbeanie babies or to the Cabbage Patch Kids where each of these dolls has a story that comes with it\\num and you guys are holding the special ones you have for this meeting of Warren and Charlie the first time you've ever\\nput a human face on one of this yeah that's the first time so what they worked out pretty good okay but the story lines was that part of it too or\\ndid you guys add to that yeah so every squishmallow has their own individual story and when we acquired Kelly toy we\\nsaw that they had this almost diamond in the rough they were people were passionate about it it wasn't available\\neverywhere it wasn't available globally and then um the BIOS were always part of it and\\nwhat made them really special because kids and adults all identified with something in the bio and so Charlie and\\nWarren both got their own bio that represented them as people not just business people but the really\\ninteresting individuals they are one of the things that I think is so amazing I mean these are cool plush toys but\\nthey're plush toys they're squishy they have become the most popular toy brand in 21 states they beat out Nerf Plato\\nthey beat out Nintendo switch and Hot Wheels how does that happen with the plush and have you guys been surprised\\nby how they've taken off of course yes it struck a nerve during covet um it was\\nthis palliative type of feel so people that were sitting at home they bought more and more squish mouths and they\\nfell in love with the product we're the number one best-selling toy in the US and in many many markets and I think\\nwhat's interesting about it is our demographic it's not just kids it's adults it's grown women it we did a\\nsquish Squad tour and we went to major cities and we looked at the line and we said wow there's not that many children\\nin the line and that's the interesting part people find it emotionally supportive [Music]\\num and that was a big surprise to us yeah people in their 50s are buying our squish Mellows wow that that's very\\nunusual in the greatest and when you found out you were being acquired by Berkshire Hathaway your thought was\\nwow wow and and what's happening uh dream come true yeah if you would have\\nasked us 26 years ago if this would ever ever happen we would say no way but\\nanything's possible in America well the interesting part is Berkshire didn't keep all the companies I think there\\nwere some they kind of got rid of they saw you guys and they chose to keep you which we were you know we I remember\\nlast year we were watching we knew the transaction was happening we watched the\\nannual shareholders meeting and we said are we going to be there next year\\nwell in fact um I think they probably are going to be here next year I think the question is how much of the floor space they're\\ngoing to get to negotiate because those have been hot cells yeah they do um we weren't the only ones who caught\\nup with them though we were actually there a little later when Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger came by to visit the Jazz Wares Booth right here in the\\nexhibition Hall and here's a funny coincidence for you both of them both Laura and Judd were lawyers before they\\nhad this career that's something they had in common with Charlie Munger too and by the way\\num they were sick of it too they wanted a job that was a little more fun\\ndid you know they're both reformed lawyers yes they both started out as lawyers well I'm ready to see a reform\\nlawyer every time\\ngoing through purchase orders yes Charlie I would like to see about 90 of\\nthe lawyers being reported this is a pinch me moment for us because we remember you know Judd started the\\ncompany by himself no financing no money no backing and just did it and worked\\nhard and of course we had many bumps in the road many many and it makes it that\\nmuch sweeter and we appreciate it and we never forget how hard it was and we're much smarter today than we were\\nyesterday I learned a lot I'm glad you were part of alligators\\nyou can catch more of our interview with Judd and Laura zaberski of jazz Wares and some other sounds from inside the\\nBerkshire Hathaway annual meeting in a special series of cnbc's daily podcast it's called squawk pod and you can just\\nscan the QR code on your screen to go ahead and follow squawkpod you can check it out and listen anytime\\nall right well joining us now is the CEO of Benjamin Moore Dan Calkins Benjamin Moore has been part of the Berkshire\\nportfolio for more than 20 years Dan uh good to have you great to be back I hope\\nyou're enjoying the weekend so far um eventful few years since you've been running the business yes uh for\\nBerkshire for at Benjamin Moore uh housing boom in conjunction with the pandemic then a little a downturn in in\\nhome related investment uh and Improvement where do things stand right now we got the inflationary pressures\\nyou've had to kind of deal with and and pass through so what's your kind of snapshot of the business right now well\\nwe're in a great spot we're actually celebrating our 140th anniversary this year at Benjamin Moore so we've been\\nthrough Cycles like this before obviously we'll be through this cycle but it has been uh what we call Benjamin\\nMoore Chasing The New Normal because we had explosive growth in 20 and 21 took a\\nlittle bit of a step back in the fourth quarter last year got off to a slow start this year but at the end of March\\nwe start to see light we're going into the paint season and people people are seeing starting to paint again and we're\\nseeing that in our numbers on a regular basis obviously Big Driver for us is housing turnover and with interest rates\\nHigh people not moving as much that has an impact on our business so as as mortgage rates hopefully start to come\\ndown we'll see more active moving and that drives to more sales for us and and just fixing things up when you cut a\\npaint we can't or we can't move so yeah exactly yeah you'll have people doing some remodeling if they're not going anywhere but the Big Driver is the churn\\nsomebody moves they pay every room every room and in terms of supply chain I mean\\nPaint and Coatings were particularly dramatically impacted yes you know during the the pandemic with a lot of\\nthe components there short supply where does it sit right now and if you retain pricing I was just looking in aggregate\\nin the in the quarterly report that you know there has been some margins Queens across the building products uh\\nbusinesses in total which is not suspicious right no we we definitely felt that we're in a good spot now\\num early last year we had about 65 days of inventory on end our historical average is about 95 days on hand I'm\\nhappy to say at the end of March we're at 96 days on hand so we're back to our historical Norms from an inventory\\nperspective we have been able to take pricing over both 21 and 22. so uh while\\nwe've felt some of the pressure and compression last year that's evening out now we're recognizing the pricing we\\ntook last year in our sales this year so things are good and so that implies that you haven't seen consumers sort of trading down or\\nanything like that when it comes to pain yeah no we have we have some particularly on the DIY side we've seen\\nsome of our product mix shift from some of our more premium products to more of our mid-range products uh but we have a\\nfull assortment full of portfolio that can meet all those price points that are out there and so we're we're seeing some\\nof that happening right now and with margin shrinks when somebody trades down how much does it's maybe six seven\\npoints on from a you know premium product to more of a commercial type product but we have healthy margins at\\nBenjamin Moore we have one of the things Warren life's best about Benjamin Moore is that premium position we carry you\\nknow there there's a big picture uh sort of long-term structural bullish story about home ownership actually\\nhomeownership rates uh ticking higher still even through this tough period of the economy and this demographic wave\\nthat's washing over but how are you thinking about you know expansion plans your ability to capture a lot of that\\nyeah so we have been growing and expanding banding not just here in North America we've been very aggressive\\nparticularly in the UK and then moving into Western Europe which is still a small part of our business but we\\nhaven't felt the impact over there because it's New Territory for us so we have explosive growth going on over\\nthere right now um very exciting and then here long term you know you to your point about families being formed that's\\nhappening with this generation that's coming into the housing market and we just think this is a blip through this period of time and as that changes we're\\nprepared to to service what we need to guys if you take a look you'll see this is live footage Warren Buffett is making\\nhis way out to the stage right now Charlie Munger will be joining him as well that means they're getting about to\\nthe end of the movie they have a long movie 45 minute movie that they show to the shareholders that's what they're\\nseeing right now and there you see Charlie Munger as well so they're being taken out the stage that means things are about to kick off there so I'm going\\nto take my lead that also means you need you have a place to go okay Mike thank you I'll see you back in just a little\\nbit thanks so much thank you all right\\nwell Insurance of course one of the big story lines in berkshire's earnings this morning joining me now to discuss is\\nevercore's David modematan he has got a buy rating by ratings on the likes of\\nTravelers Progressive and Chubb uh uh from evercore isi and uh and Dave thanks\\nfor joining us uh this morning we were just talking about how over the first quarter berkshire's Insurance businesses\\nspecifically Geico did make some moves on pricing uh kind of fattened up the margins reducing advertising spend uh it\\nseems like maybe an industry-wide Trend but what's been happening overall in the competitive uh landscape when it comes\\nto those Insurance lines yeah thanks for having me um so you are seeing just a massive hard\\nMarket in the personal auto insurance space and Geico has actually taken you\\nknow fairly aggressive action on that front um and you can see that you know the focus on profitability is really\\ncoming through in in these results where their policies enforce shrank 13 and you\\nknow that's partly because you know there are premium per policy which is a good proxy for their price increases you\\nknow is up 15 uh which is you know among the highest that I've seen you know\\nAllstate was up 16 Progressive was up you know close to that level so the entire industry is Raising price\\num for guy for Geico it looks like they've actually seen you know the their\\nunits come down quite a bit and that's resulted in them having better frequency Dynamics which is you know really help\\ntheir earnings and you know another thing I've noticed is um you know they really cut their ad spend to really\\nfocusing on you know what what people they're underwriting to focus on profitability\\nI appreciate that color uh David that was uh that's great we're going to hear a lot more about that in the Q a in the\\nshareholder meeting and we're going to actually get to Becky and Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger for Q a we'll see you\\nback here at 1pm Eastern time when Buffett and Munger break for lunch ahead of their afternoon q a session and the\\nofficial shareholder meeting they are taking the stage uh right now as you can see and we go there live morning good\\nmorning and thanks for coming I love it Charlie loves it we're glad to\\nhave you here we're going to make this this uh\\npreliminary before the question is very short because we want to get in at least\\n60 Questions half divided by the the audience outside this\\nArena and half from you so I would just\\nlike to get right to the to the directors and the earnings that\\nhave been put up on the uh on our webpage this morning but we'll\\ncover those very fast and we'll get to the questions now I\\nwhen I woke up this morning I realized that\\nwe had a competitive broadcast going out\\nuh somewhere in the UK and and\\nthey were they were celebrating a King Charles and we've got our own\\nKing Charles here today [Applause]\\nand next to him we have Greg Abel we was in charge of all the\\noperations except for insurance next\\n[Applause] [Music] [Applause]\\nand next to Greg we have uh a man I ran into a 1986 and\\nhas made us look good ever since we have the man in charge of insurance Ajit Jane Jaden\\nand now we have our our directors here in front and if they would just stand briefly and then I'll go on\\nto the next one and and uh they're all here today first of all\\ndoing alphabetically there's Howard Buffett\\nthere's Suzy Buffett\\nthere's Steve Burke\\nKen Chenal\\nChris Davis\\nSue Decker Charlotte Diamond\\nTom Murphy Jr Ron Olsen\\nWally Weiss and Merle Whitburn\\nthat's as good as you can get and there's one other person I would like to mention before we\\nget onto the earnings that were put on the uh in the press release this morning and\\nuh uh that's uh uh\\nwell let's see who we have here we've got this is hard to believe\\ncan you imagine a name Melissa Shapiro Shapiro\\nand she was uh Melissa Shapiro Joseph married another Shapiro and she put this\\nwhole thing together with no help from me no help from Charlie and a lot of\\nhelp from the people of the other room Melissa\\nyeah it's very easy if you can remember her second name you can remember her third name so Melissa shabiro Shapiro\\nand with that I would like to next move on to the\\nearnings and a couple small slides that that explain what\\nwe're all about and then we're going to get to the Q a and uh the slide is up behind me yeah there it\\nis we reported in the first quarter\\noperating earnings a little over 8 billion and when we talk about operating\\nearnings we're basically referring to the earnings\\nof Berkshire Hathaway as generally well as required under gaap excluding however\\ncapital gains both realized and unrealized there's a few other very minor items but basically\\nwe expect to make capital gains over time why would we own the stocks otherwise uh doesn't always work out but\\noverall it works out pretty well over time but in any day any quarter any year\\neven occasionally over a five-year period uh the stock prices move around\\ncapriciously now we own a lot of other businesses we consider those stocks businesses we own a lot of other\\nbusinesses where they get Consolidated and they don't move around in value now if we had a little bit of Burlington\\nstock outstanding if we had a little bit of the energy stock trading those stocks\\nwould move around a lot but the businesses are what count so the\\noperating earnings as you'll see in the first quarter came in at about 8 billion\\nand I would say that in the general economy\\nthe feedback we get is that uh I would say perhaps the majority of our\\nbusinesses will actually report lower earnings this year\\nthan last year the in various degrees in the last six months or so at various times\\nuh the the businesses have left the incredible\\nperiod which is about as extraordinaries I've seen in business since World War II\\nuh with the government would pour out a lot of money to people who couldn't get\\nGoods it was more extreme in World War II but this was extreme this time and it was just a question\\nof getting Goods the deliverer and people bought and they didn't wait for sales and if\\nyou couldn't sell them one thing they would put another thing in their backlog it was an extraordinary period and that\\nperiod uh has ended it hasn't ended with as you\\nknow it isn't that employment's fault or off a cliff or anything in the least but\\nbut uh it is a different climate than it was six months ago and and a\\nnumber of our managers uh were surprised some of them had too much inventory on order and then all of\\na sudden it got delivered and people weren't in the same frame of mind as earlier\\nand now we'll start having sales at places where we didn't need to have sales before but\\nuh despite the fact that this year I think in general will\\nbe slower than last year we actually are\\nsituated so that I would expect and believe me when I say accept expect\\nit's nothing is sure nothing sure tomorrow nothing sure next year and nothing is\\never sure either in markets or in business forecasts or anything else and we don't\\npay much attention to markets or forecasts unless the markets happen to offer something interesting to do but\\nnevertheless we are positioned in two respects as you'll see from from this uh first report our investment\\nincome is going to be a lot larger uh this year than last year and that's\\nthat's built in I mean we have as you'll see in a minute we've had 125\\nbillion or so and very short term investments and\\nand believe it or not uh not that long ago\\nwe were getting four basis points which is next to nothing\\non that 100 125 billion which means we were getting 50 million a year\\nand now the same money the other just day or day before yesterday we\\nactually bought because of some of the funny twist in the market because of doubts about the\\ndeficit ceiling of the debt ceiling uh we bought three billion of bills of the\\n590 that's 5.9 there's a 5.92 bond\\nequivalent yield so we will have what produced us not that\\nlong ago on a 12-month basis was producing 50 million a year producing uh something in the area of 5 billion\\nhere so we're in a position where the investment income is essentially well it\\nis certain to increase quite a bit and insurance underwriting\\nis not it uh it does not correlate\\nwith business activity it depends on things like hurricanes and earthquakes\\nand and other events so on a prospective basis on a probability\\nbasis we're likely to have a a better year\\nuh this year in Insurance underwriting than we had last year uh it just isn't\\naffected by what you might call the business cycle or uh what applies to generally an\\nindustry detailing you name it uh so I would expect\\nand one massive earthquake or one one hurricane that came into just\\nthe wrong place uh would can affect that prediction but on a\\nprobabilistic basis our insurance looks better this year so if you get two of those\\ntwo of the elements there of our main office of earnings that look like they\\nwill swing in our Direction I would expect but I can't promise that our operating and earnings will be\\ngreater than last year and if we'll move to\\nthe second slide uh I give you those operating earnings\\nfigures just to give you a overview of what has happened\\nuh since the pandemic started and off of the year\\nthe yearbook before as a base and we retain all our earnings as you know\\nso if we're retaining 30 or 35 billion or whatever but maybe a year you should\\nexpect more operating earnings over time I mean this this number should be\\nsignificantly higher five or ten or fifteen years from now because we have the advantage of retaining earnings and\\nthat's what got us to these figures because they were essentially nothing when we started and they got there by\\nretaining earnings and we'll keep retaining earnings so it's no great Triumph if these numbers move up and\\nwhat we hope is that they move up at a reasonable rate historically\\nthey moved up at an unreasonable rate sometimes but we're working with a much smaller sums then and that can't be\\nrepeated with our present Capital base because I note there I believe it's on this slide let's take\\na look uh now that'll be\\nsee it's on the while on the on the next on the next\\nplace paid and let's move to the next slide we showed that we had on March 31st\\nnow 500 and was it five hundred and four billion\\nof Gap net worth now what might surprise you\\nis that there's no other company in the United States no other company that has a number\\nthat is that large now that isn't because we've got the most valuable\\ncompany in the United States other companies have used their money to repurchase\\nshares they could have accumulated 504 billion in gap but basically we have more\\nunder Gap accounting now than any other company in the U.S and of course if you\\nmeasure return on on Equity that becomes a very big number to increase\\nat a rapid rate but we hope to do so uh not a rapid rate additional rate\\num and right below that you see something called float\\nand float is money that uh is left in our hands\\nuh somewhat Akin but very importantly different\\nthan a bank deposit but it uh you have to pay interest to get a bank deposit and you have to pay more\\ninterest these days and you have to run a bank and do a lot of things and basically this is money that represents\\nunpaid losses at this time you get paid in advance in insurance so what shows up\\nas a net liability on our balance sheet is gives us funds uh\\ndo exercise with an amount of discretion that no other insurance company that I know of in the\\nworld enjoys just because we have so much net worth and our float now\\ncomes to 165 billion and the man sitting on the far left is\\nresponsible for moving that number up from a pittance in 1986\\nto this incredible figure which in most years practically all years\\nhasn't cost us anything so it's like having a bank with no employees no\\ninterest and no ability to withdraw the money in\\na hurry that we have working for us and it's a\\nvery valuable asset that uh that shows up as a liability and uh\\nAjit is responsible for building up this\\ntreasure uh which has done been done by out competing insurance companies all over\\nthe world and then now a number of our insurance companies in turn are run by talented managers\\nwho contributed one way or another uh start with Geico\\nthe beginning of my career and the uh that float if you think about it just\\nthink of a balance sheet you've got liabilities here and you got assets over here and and the liability side finances\\nthe asset side is very simple and stockholders Equity finances it\\nlong-term debt finances and so on but stockholders Equity is very expensive in\\na real sense long-term debt has been cheap for a while but it can get expensive and it\\ncan also become new eventually and it and it may not be available\\nuh but float is another item which shows it's a\\nliability but hasn't cost us anything and it it can't disappear in a hurry and\\nit finances the asset side in the same way a stockholders equity\\nand nobody else thinks of it much that way but but we've always thought of it that way and it's built up over time so\\nuh I show at the bottom what's happened with cash and treasury bills\\nthrough March 31st and I will tell you that the in the month of April\\nwe probably added about seven billion dollars to that\\nfactor now part of that is because we didn't buy as much stock because that reduces reduces cash and treasury bills\\nwe bought about 400 million dollars worth of stock in the month of April that's that's a minus uh in terms of\\ncash available and uh uh we we however sold not some stock\\nwhich produced maybe four billion and of course we had operating earnings probably two and a half\\nbillion or something in that area and my guess is we've probably increased our cash and treasury bills uh six and seven\\nbillion in the month and uh I just want to give you a feel for how the cash\\nflows at Berkshire and then if we move to the final I think it's the final one next to the last one uh\\nno I I think it is a lot let's see it's the fourth yeah is this we should have the one up\\nthere class a equivalent shares outstanding and and uh you'll notice that every year\\nthe number of our shares go down so if we own more businesses and the businesses make more money\\nyour chair as shareholders as owners a Berkshire increases every year without\\nyou laying out any money now you're laying out the uh the\\nalternative which you could receive in dividends but the reason we've gotten to\\nwhere we are is because we we kept the money we did pay a dividend\\nin 19. 67 10 cents to share it was a terrible mistake and uh I\\nI always tell people that I I'd love for the men's room and the directors voted while he's gone but that isn't true I\\nwas there I confessed they uh but we're very invested and has produced the\\n500 billion plus of shareholders equity in the 30 billion plus of operating\\nearnings and and we'll continue to follow that policy because it makes a great deal of sense and uh\\nwith that I think we've taken care of the preliminaries you can study that\\nthe 10q is is on the uh on the uh web page and if you have a\\nweek or two vacation you could spend it reading the 10q and but that is the\\nessence of Berkshire and with that I will start with Becky quick and and uh we\\nwill alternate between Becky and and the audience and her questions have come in\\nfrom all over the country and I believe you identified the sender and go to it Becky thanks Warren the first question\\ncomes in from Randy Jeffs in Irvine California and his question is if Silicon Valley Bank's deposit had not\\nbeen fully covered what do you think the economic consequences would have been to the nation\\nsimply say it would have been catastrophic and that's why they were covered uh and\\neven though the FDIC limiters two hundred and fifty thousand dollars that that's the way the statute reads\\nbut that is not the way the us is going to behave uh any more than they're going to let\\nthe debt ceiling uh uh cause the world to go into turmoil and uh they\\nuh well they're just I can't imagine\\nanybody in the administration and the Congress and the Federal Reserve whatever it may\\nhave been FDIC I can't imagine anybody's saying uh I'd like to be the one on\\ntelevision tomorrow and explain the American public why we're keeping uh\\nuh only two hundred and fifty thousand dollars insured and we're gonna start around every Bank in the country and\\ndisrupt the world financial system uh so uh I think it was inevitable Charlie The\\nAmity no I have nothing to add\\napparently I should mention this now ajeet and Greg will be here in the\\nmorning session which ends at noon and so uh it's got questions to direct to\\nthem the time to do it is in the first half of the show and and then after lunch\\nthat'll just Charlie and I will be back okay\\narea one hi nirav Patel Haverhill Massachusetts\\nMr Buffett Mr Monger it seems like you found the Sweet Spot between being too\\nconservative and too aggressive as investors do you ever make bad investment\\ndecisions because of your emotions and what do you do to try to keep that from\\nhappening well we make\\nbad investment decisions uh plenty of times I make more than Charlie\\nbecause I'm I like to think it's because I make more decisions but probably more batting average is worse but\\nI can't recall anytime\\nin the history of Berkshire the women in an emotional decision that\\nI know the movie had Jamie Lee in there but that that was for Laughs\\nI mean Jamie Jamie Lee she's good but she's not\\ngood enough to get me or Charlie to make an emotional decision\\nlaughs Charlie\\nI'm sure you have something to add on that\\nwell it's a different movie than it is shown in most corporate meetings [Laughter]\\npersonal decision no I don't know that's in business we're talking about\\nyeah no you don't want to be a no emotion person in all of your life but you you definitely want to be a no more\\nno emotion person to making an investment or business decision that uh you can argue that that uh uh\\nwith it we probably I would say that we\\n've made an emotional decision perhaps and when a manager has been with us for\\nsome period and we haven't we've\\nwe we've ignored the fact that perhaps they weren't quite what\\nthey were earlier but our businesses are so good that they they've run better sometimes\\nuh when uh well I've talked about\\nWest Coast for example the wonderful Louisville it ran on\\nit ran on automatic pilot for a while but I don't think we suffered to buy it but you can argue\\nthat if Charlie and I hadn't liked Louie as much as we did we might have spotted\\na little bit early but I don't think it made any difference in the results would you would you agree with that Charlie\\nyeah yeah we totally with it and\\nI'm glad we behaved the way we did it Wesco by the way we bought the thing for\\na few tens of millions and it became worth two or three billion\\nyeah that wasn't common in the Savings and Loan businesses you may have noticed they want they really went crazy in that\\nindustry and and we had a wonderful guy in Louis and we didn't go crazy yeah we didn't go crazy\\ndumb okay Becky\\nthis question comes from Ben Knoll in Minneapolis he says he's a Berkshire shareholder of three decades and he's\\nattended many Berkshire meetings he's here again this year and this is addressed to Ajit and Greg he says last\\nyear I asked you about how Geico and BNSF appeared to lose ground to their leading competitors Geico on telematics\\nand BNSF on Precision scheduled railroading Ajit you responded by saying how you expected Geico to make progress\\nin a year or two Greg you spoke about your pride in BNSF but you didn't directly address the threat of precision\\nscheduled railroading will each of you please provide perspective on these competitive challenges and our company's\\nstrategies to address them let me\\nin terms of Geico and telematics let me make the observation that Geico has\\ncertainly taken the ball by the horns and has made rapid strides in terms of trying to bridge the gap\\nin terms of telematics and its competitors they have now reached a point where on\\nall new business close to 90 percent is has a telematics input to to the\\npricing decision unfortunately less than half of that is being taken up by the policyholders the\\nother point I want to make is even though we have made improvements in in terms of Bridging the Gap on telematics\\nwe still haven't started to realize the true benefit and the real culprit or the\\nbottleneck is technology Geico's technology needs a lot more work than I thought it did\\nit has more than 500 actually more than 600 Legacy systems that don't really talk to each other and we're trying to\\ncompress them to no more than 15 16 systems that all talk to each other\\nthat's a Monumental Challenge and because of that even though we have made improvements in telematics we still have\\na long way to go because of Technology [Music]\\nbecause of that and because of the whole issue more broadly in terms of matching rate to risk Geico is still work in\\nprogress I don't know if you any of you had a chance to look at the first quarter results but Geico has had a very\\ngood first quarter coming in at a combined ratio of 93 and change which means a margin of six and change\\nuh even though that's very good it's not something we can take to the bank because they're two unusual items that\\ncontributed to it firstly we've had what is called prior year Reserve releases\\nwe've reduced results for the previous years and that contributed to it and secondly every year the first quarter\\ntends to be a seasonally good quote of auto insurance writers\\nso if you just for those two factors my guess is the end of the year Geico will end up with a combined ratio just south\\nof 100 as opposed to the Target they're shooting for 96.\\nI hope they reached the target of 96 by the end of next year\\nand but instead of getting too excited about it I think it's important to realize that even if we reach 96 it will\\ncome at the expense of having lost policy holder there is a trade-off between\\nprofitability and growth and clearly we have we're going to emphasize\\nprofitability and not growth and that will come at the expense of policyholder so it will not be until two years from\\nnow that we'll be back on track fighting the battles on both the profitability and growth front\\nGreg yep moving to BNSF\\nI'll start again by expressing great pride in the BNSF team we have an exceptional group of led by Katie and\\nand her managers that uh show up every day to do great work on on the railroad\\nat the same time they would be the first to acknowledge there's more to be done there uh the specific reference to\\nPrecision scheduled railroading the other large railroad Class A uh\\nrailroads in the in the U.S follow that and including the two in Canada we're\\nwell aware of what they're doing and and obviously pay close attention to their\\noperating Matrix and our team strives every day to be more efficient obviously I would say we balance it with the needs\\nof our customers if I look back to pre-2022 so we look at the three-year\\nperiod of 2019 2020 2021 the BNSF team\\nmade significant progress on their efficiencies and and and delivering\\noverall value back to the shareholders and and to their customers and at the same time maintaining a very safe\\nrailroad for our employees so we're making excellent progress that didn't stop last year they made great progress\\nagain the reality in 2022 as we did go through a period of time where we had to\\ncall it reset the railroad we came out of the pandemic there were the supply challenges we had certain other issue\\nlabor issues and other things going on at the port and the reality is our team prioritized getting the railroad back in\\nplace for the long term not a short-term focus on hitting certain operating metrics in in\\n2022 we're well aware of where we were relative to those metrics but the real Focus was to get the railroad reset in a\\nin a safe manner such that we could deliver long-term value and long-term service to our customers and and that's\\nreally what we'll continue to see with that team they'll be continual progress there'll be years where it's not as\\nquickly or even we go backwards but over the long term we'll be very uh we'll see\\nexceptional results from from that team and and couldn't be more proud that we have that asset thank you\\nI wouldn't I would just [Applause] well he deserves but both of them\\ndeserve Applause the I would like to add one thing [Applause]\\n[Music] [Applause] the\\nuh at Geico .com's uh\\nwas ajith's Choice my choice go back to guy at Geico\\nto work on the problem of matching rate to risk which is what\\ninsurance is all about and uh he arrived\\nwith exquisite timing right before the pandemic broke out all kinds of things changed but Todd is\\ndoing a wonderful job at Geico and uh and he\\nworks closely uh with the Jeep but because he saw his home and all Morgan comes back\\nhere and we we get together on the weekend sometimes too so uh uh that's been a\\na remarkable com accomplishment under difficult circumstances and he's not all the way home but he's a he's made a very\\nvery big change uh in multiple ways Geico and then one\\nother thing I would like to mention there have been a lot of public companies created in the last decade\\nthereabouts in insurance and uh there's none of them\\nthat we would like to own and and they always started out in their perspective saying this is\\na tech company not an insurance company of course we're of course they're in a tech company where everybody's\\nwhether they're in insurance or a lot of other places are using the facility but\\nyou still have to properly match rate to risk and uh uh that they invariably have\\nreported the huge losses they've eaten up capital but there's been one company that nobody\\nhas generally heard of there's only been one that I know of company started in the last 10 years\\nthat has been a overwhelming success and that's a company that a g\\nand four people who join with them set to develop a new business\\nit's called Berkshire Hathaway specialty it now has uh what's the float a g coming up to 12\\nbillion yeah we've we've built more slope than probably all these companies combined\\nwe've now it it's cost us essentially nothing in terms of an underwriting loss\\nthe four people have turned in I don't know 1500 around the world we we took on the whole industry and we brought\\nsome unique how and the four people that came and\\nnow have like I said 1500 or so worldwide and we brought capital and we\\nbrought okay capabilities that really only Berkshire\\ncould Supply so it was the it was the combination of of\\nbrains and talent and energy and money and no one has really successfully\\nentered this this space plenty of people in the space who didn't\\nlike us coming and we did it without it costing us a dime of Entry\\nand it's been unmatched by any of the public companies that went public\\nand people have seen us do it but they can't duplicate it and that's\\nwhat Vegeta's created and Peter Eastwood has led this group Berkshire Hathaway\\nspecially and uh it's just remarkable so anyway with that let's go on yeah give\\nhim a hand for that [Music]\\nokay let's go to section two\\nhi Charlie I'm our end I'm Karen here\\nyour priorities are right yes I have a questions on AI and\\nRobotics here's my questions as Ai and Robotics continue to advance what do you\\nbelieve will be the positive and an active impact of this technology\\non both the stocks markets and society as a whole and are there any specific\\nIndustrials and companies that you believe will be most impacted\\nKaren I thank you for asking Charlie that question\\nwell if you went into byd's factories in\\nChina you would see robotics going in the unbelievable rate\\nso we're gonna see a lot more robotics in the world I am personally\\nskeptical of some of the hype that has gone into artificial intelligence I think old-fashioned intelligence works\\npretty well thank you [Applause]\\nthere won't be a there won't be anything in AI that replaces the gene\\nthe state that unqualifyingly they can do amazing things uh\\nuh you know Bill Gates brought me out of out\\nthe latest maybe not the latest version but when he thought maybe I could handle which that has to be careful with me in\\nterms of leading me too fast uh and it did it did these remarkable things uh it\\ndidn't but it it it couldn't tell jokes well Bill told me that ahead of time and it prepared me and it it just isn't\\nthere but you know with things like checking all the legal opinions on you\\nknow since the beginning of time and everything and eliminating all the\\nsided I mean it can do all kinds of things and when something can do all kinds of\\nthings I get a little bit worried uh and uh because I know we won't be able to\\nuninvent it and uh you know we did invent\\nuh for very very good reason the atom bomb and in World War II and it\\nwas you know it was enormously important that we did so\\nbut is it good for the next 200 years of the world that that the ability to do so has\\nbeen Unleashed we didn't have a choice but uh uh\\nwhen you start something well Einstein said after this has changed everything in the world\\nexcept how men think and uh I would say the same thing May\\nnot not the same thing I don't mean that but I mean they with with AI\\nuh it it can change everything in the world accept it how men think and behave\\nand that's that's a big step to take it's a good question and it's the best\\nanswer we can give Becky this question comes from Tom Seymour he\\nsays the first sentence of a recent Financial Times article read Charlie\\nMunger has warned of a brewing storm in the U.S commercial property Market with American Banks full of what he said were\\nbad loans as property prices fall please elaborate on what's going on in commercial real estate how bad will the\\nlosses be and what sectors or geographies look particularly bad I'll just add an addendum from another viewer\\nwho wrote in and wanted to know if Berkshire would be more active in commercial real estate as a result\\nthank you well berkshire's never been very\\nimportant very active in commercial real estate it it works better for taxable investors\\nthan it does for corporations tax the way Berkshire is so\\nI I don't anticipate huge effects on Berkshire but I do think that\\nthe hollowing out of the downtowns in the United States and elsewhere in the\\nworld is going to be quite significant and quite unpleasant I think the country will get through it\\nall right but as they say it will awfully it will often involve a different set of owners\\nyeah in the buildings the buildings don't go away but the owners do well but\\nbut most people like to buy with non-recourse and and real estate and and\\none time I asked Charlie there was some real estate guy we were talking to him and you know how do they decide how much\\nthey can a building like this is worth and it's the answer is it's whatever they can borrow without signing their\\nname and if you look at real estate generally you'll understand\\nwhat the phenomena is happening if you if you remind yourself that that's the\\nattitude of most people that have uh become big in in the real estate\\nbusiness and and uh and it does mean that the lenders are\\nthe ones that that the property and of course they don't want the property usually so then\\nthe real estate operator comes on negotiating with them and and the banks\\ntend to you know stand and pretend and there's all kinds\\nof activities that arrive out of out of commercial real estate development which\\noccurs on a big big scale but it all has consequences and and I think we're\\nwe're about well we are starting to see the consequences of people who could borrow\\nit two and a half percent find out it doesn't work at current\\nrates and they hand it back to somebody that gave them all the money they needed to build it\\nthem Charlie's having more experience than really Charlie ought to start in real estate though I mean Charlie Charlie\\nyes it it's difficult\\nI like what we do better well as Charlie once said to me when I\\nwas leaving his house a few months ago I was visiting him we talked for a couple\\nof hours and I said to Charlie as I left I just wasn't anybody else in the house and I said except\\none daughter and I said uh Charlie yellow I'll just keep doing what we've been doing and Charlie\\nsaid without looking up or pausing a second he said that's all you know how to do Warren yeah\\nhe was right too uh station three is it\\nhi uh my name is Dallas I'm from Santa Santa Clara California and my question\\nis to Charlie and and Warren given the rise of disruptive technologies that can\\nimprove productivity significantly and AI being one of them how do you envision\\nthe future of value investing in this new era and what adaptations or new\\nprinciples do you think investors should adopt and any recommendations for investors to remain successful in this\\nrapid changing landscape thank you\\nI think value investors are going to have a harder time now that there's so many of them competing first\\na diminished bunch of opportunities so my advice to Value investors is to\\nget used to making less and\\nCharlie was been telling me the same thing the whole time we've known each other wait wait we get along wonderfully\\nbecause we are making less yeah well but that's because that mostly I think is because it's larger we were\\nyounger we never thought we could manage 508 billion no one or five yeah but I I\\nwould argue that uh that uh there's gonna be plenty of opportunities\\nand part of the reason they're going to be plenty of opportunities the the tech\\ndoesn't make any difference or any of that I mean if you look at how the world changed in them in the years since 1942 when I've\\nstarted to say well out of the kid that doesn't know anything about airplanes it doesn't know anybody androgens and cars and doesn't\\nknow anything about them electricity and all that but that really isn't the that's not there the world\\nchanging doesn't or new things coming along don't take away the opportunities what gives you opportunities is other\\npeople doing dumb things and it's a\\nand I would say that\\nwell the 58 years we've been running Berkshire I would say there's been a great increase\\nuh in the number of people doing dumb things and they do big dumb things and\\nthe reason they do it to some extent is because they they can get money from other people so much easier\\nthan when we started so you could start 10 or 15 dumb insurance companies in the\\nlast 10 years and you could become rich uh if you were a Droid at it whether the\\nbusiness exceeded it or not and the underwriters got paid and the lawyers got paid and that creates\\nif that's not on a large scale which it couldn't be done what 58 years ago you\\ncouldn't get the money to do some of the dumb things that we wanted to do fortunately uh and uh so\\nI know I think that investing has disappeared so much from\\nthis huge capitalistic Market that anybody can play in\\nbut the big money is in selling other people ideas it isn't outperforming in\\noutperforming and I think that I think if you don't run too much money\\nwhich we do but if you're running small amounts of money I think I think the opportunities\\nwill be greater but then Charlie and I have always differed on this subject he he likes to tell me how gloomy the world\\nlives and and I I like to tell them we'll find something and and so far\\nwe've both been kind of right\\n[Music]\\nso much money now in the hands of so many smart people all trying to outsmart one another\\nand not promote one another getting more money out of other people and\\nit's a radically different world from the world we started in\\nI suppose it will have its opportunities but it's also going to have some unpleasant\\nepisodes but they're trying to outsmart each other in arenas that you don't have to play I\\nmean if you look at that Government Bond Market the field at the treasury ball Market I mean you've got this one bill\\nthat's out of line with the others when we bought over three billion of us the other day and and but\\nthose are people the world is overwhelmingly\\nshort-term focused and if you go to an investor relations call they're all\\ntrying to figure out how to fill out a sheet to show the earnings for the year and the management is interested in\\nfeeding them expectations that will slightly be beaten I mean that that is\\nthe world that's made to order for anybody that's trying to think about what you do that should work over five\\nor ten or Twenty Years and uh I I just think that\\nI would love to be born today and go out with not too much money and hopefully\\nturn it into a lot of money but and surely would too actually just like\\nhe would find something to do I will just guarantee you uh and it wouldn't be\\nexactly the same as before but he would have a big big pile I would not like the thrill of\\nlosing my big pile into a small pot\\nbut we make my big piles is the Way It Is Well I like we agree on that incidentally okay we do\\nyou're one of the most extreme lovers of the big pile\\nBecky this question is for both Warren and a g\\nit comes from Jason ploner in Livingston New Jersey he says in 2016 you entered\\nit into a very unique transaction with AIG where you assumed up to 20 billion dollars of liabilities in exchange for\\nabout 10 billion dollars up front can you please provide us with an update on this transaction in light of the\\nincrease in interest rates and then in Tokyo just a few weeks ago you talked about the risks of banks with assets\\nthat were susceptible to Rising interest rates any insight as to how Berkshire liabilities are susceptible to duration\\nwould be appreciated is that a direction to ajita or me or what both okay let me\\nintroduce it my one thing and well but Ajit is the key to this she's the one to put the deal together but we got handed\\n10 billion we'll say uh uh and but we weren't restricted to putting\\nthat into in the bonds uh so what the exact interest rate interest\\nrates affect us to some degree maybe in terms of the terms uh of the deal we did\\nwith AIG or anybody we would do a similar deal with like that but we don't have we don't have to put\\nit in matching bonds or anything of the sort it goes into a general pool of assets which we manage in the assets you\\nknow well the liquid assets now are 130 billion plus and that but it goes and so\\nit you know it it it is not set aside in some little compartment like people like\\nto think uh now any any other insurance no other insurance company could do it but they can't think that way uh they\\naren't even used to thinking that way but they can't think that way because they don't have our our balance sheet we account for 26 or something like that of\\nthe net worth of all property casualty companies in the United States uh so\\nuh so far uh the payments that we have had to make\\nhave run modestly and a Jeep will correct me on this if I'm wrong because\\nhe paid a lot of attention over the the amount we have had to pay has runs\\nslightly below the amount we anticipated having to pay in terms of our share of the losses uh\\nbut it served aig's purposes it came to us with\\nwhere we are in a unique position there's nobody else that was able to write that just like when when we took\\non the Lloyds I mean Lloyd's said there was no choice other than Berkshire\\nHathaway when they they essentially resuscitated uh their Market by laying\\noff a lot of liabilities on on Berkshire Hathaway so\\num we won't see those deals very often if if they're for 500 million or something like that somebody else will\\ngo in there and offer more money and everybody's looking for money in Wall Street but if they start talking with\\nthe deal like the AIG deal there isn't any other stop now uh correct me on all my numbers there\\nJade no um one way to look at how the deal is\\nperforming since we did the deal is at the point we in time when we did the deal we had made certain projections of\\nhow much we will pay out each year and what we do is Monitor what the\\nactual payments are since the Inception of the deal and how does that compare with what we expected to pay out\\nas Warren mentioned these two numbers are very close to each other more specifically the actual payouts are 96\\npercent of what we had projected to pay out at this point in time which is good but not great we are still\\nahead of the curve if we do end up paying out less than what we projected Not only would we have borrowed money at\\na very attractive rate meaning less than four percent significantly less than four percent in addition to that we\\nwould have made a fee which in 1990 which in 2015 dollars would be a million\\ndollars so if we would have borrowed money at less than four percent and we would have made a million dollar fee\\nwhich is slightly more than what we were expecting to do so net net we're very\\nhappy with the deal we're happy we did it but the game is not over the taught\\nliabilities they're coming down the pike every second day so I'm cautiously optimistic that the deal will work out\\nbetter than what we expected it to work out a really interesting thing is that\\nin within Berkshire the Casualty Insurance companies have four times as\\nmuch stockholder Capital between behind each dollar of Premium volume\\nfour times normal and of course we see the big deals who\\nwould you trust if you had a big liability you wanted to dump on somebody and we have 25 or\\nbillion or more coming in from things other than insurance\\nuncorrelated to Insurance every year with no obligations we don't pay dividends if you paid evidence and\\nyou know and you cut your dividend try going around trying to write insurance the next day I mean it's a business\\nwhere the people are counting on you to pay and when we take that 10 billion we\\ndon't agree to put it in five-year bonds and 10-year bonds we don't even think\\nthat way and the people who do business with us know that they have somebody\\nlike nobody else on those and it's going to be able to pay 10 billion you know\\nit's no matter what happens to the economy uh so it's not only the presence of enormous strength in the insurance\\ncompanies it's the fact we got all these earnings that essentially come in every month and we don't have we don't have a\\nlot of debt I mean we we have debt at the railroad and the energy level but but in terms of the rest of the\\noperation uh uh and we don't guarantee that debt but but it's probably what uh\\nand it's there just isn't another Berkshire and uh and the Jeep recognizes\\nthat when he's negotiating so does the other party if sums are big enough there's all kinds of people that love to\\nget 500 million or 300 million and they'll and they can they may think in terms of lending it\\nout because that's what their insurance companies can do at a somewhat higher rate but that is not a game we play in\\nand we don't have any interest in playing okay station four\\nhello I'm Marvin Blum an estate planning lawyer from Fort Worth Texas home to\\nmany of your companies in fact Warren I met you at the memorial for our beloved\\nPaul Andrews who was manager of TTI\\nI'd like to get your thoughts on a widespread problem in the world of Estate Planning and that's the failure\\nof most parents to prepare the Next Generation for the inheritance coming\\ntheir way in particular if the estate includes a\\nfamily business most parents fail to do business succession planning to plan for\\nwho will run the business on the day when not if the founder is no longer\\nthere to run it the kids aren't prepared unlike uh King Charles the the other\\nKing Charles not King Charlie Munger who has been preparing for his job as king\\nof England now for more than 70 years I sometimes describe the situation like\\nthis picture a football game at one end of the field is a quarterback\\nhe has great skills he throws a beautiful pass to the other end of the field and at the other end of the field are\\nthe receivers they've never been to a practice they don't know the rules of the game\\nthey don't know how to work together as a team they're Clueless so the quarterback is the patriarch and\\nThe Matriarch the football is the inheritance or the family business\\nand the receivers are the kids that they're going to catch the football\\nand go score a touchdown probably only around 10 percent I've got the picture\\num [Applause]\\nthe I probably observed as many just because\\nof my age and to some extent because of things like the giving places I probably observed as many\\nparticularly wealthy families the problems and they all are again very particular\\nto the family and and\\nuh in my family I do not sign a will\\nuntil my three children have read it understand it and made suggestions now\\nmy children are in their 60s and that would not have been a great one success if I'd done the same thing as\\ntheir 20s it depends on the Family it depends on how the kids feel about each other there's all kinds of things\\ndepends on the kind of business you have so there's a there's a thousand variables but I do think\\nthat it's if the children are grown and when the\\nwill is read to them it's the first they've heard about what the deceased thought about things\\nthe parents have made a terrible mistake and uh people\\npeople who well I've run into all kinds of situations and some people don't tell\\ntheir children anything and some of them try and get them to vendor their will by using their their own personal will they\\nmake a million mistakes and that's when you don't get to correct\\nuh you know certainly in my well Charlie's had a lot of experience too\\nwell at Berkshire we have a simple problem of uh\\nestate planning just hold the goddamn stock\\n[Applause] I mean that you know\\nI don't think it necessarily I don't know necessarily whether if you have billions of dollars you want to\\nleave it to your all your children I mean that's something that's another question but if you go to places somewhere I just as soon as Berkshire\\nstock is down oh you're solving the investment problems yeah but you've got the personal problem of the fact that\\nwhen they were four one of the kids pulled the other kids uh cat's tail or something like that I\\nmean you're dealing with human beings and the biggest thing you want\\nis you want you want your children to get along I mean they want that all through your life and the estate isn't the only place\\nwhere you can mess that up but the it's the place where you it's a very easy\\nI mean I know a number of cases where the people did not know what was in the will whether we're human's involved and\\nyou know within about 15 minutes each one of them had a lawyer and you know they don't get a long sense of it it's\\nit's a it's important to handle it right and uh uh it's important if you want\\nyour kids to have a certain value with certain values it's important that you live\\nthose values it's important that you talk about it to them or\\nthey're going they're learning from you from the day they're born what you're\\nreally like and uh don't think that a cleverly drawn will will substitute for\\nyour own behavior in teaching your kids the values you hope that they will have\\nand then your will should be in conjunction with that it should start expressing and they grow it's older and\\nthen they they learn to they they learn to\\npass along their values in connection with the size of the state if there's Family Farms it's one thing if it's a\\nbunch of marketable Securities is something else but I know in one instance by a particularly Rich fellow that once\\na year you get his kids together and have a dinner and do all kinds of things to get\\nthem to sign their income tax returns in blank because they didn't want them to know how much money they had and\\neverything well if that that isn't going to work I mean I don't know why necessarily real words\\nwith him but uh if you want you know about Charlie and I've said it\\nyou know if you want to figure out how you want to live your life you you write your obituary in reverse engineer I mean\\nyou know and uh and Paul Andrews incidentally who you mentioned that TTI\\nlived as great a life as anybody I've known and uh he he thought about these\\nproblems and he came to me he was 61 I think had all the money Way\\nBeyond what he needed didn't care about he'd like to give it to give it to people he had all kinds of good things\\nhe wanted to do and he said for a year I've been worried about my business TTI and he said I've got all the money I\\nneed the families get all the money that I need but what do I do with the business these people have\\nthat helped me throughout my life and he says I can sell it to a competitor and if I sold it to a competitor they'd fire\\nmy people and keep their people when they put it together and if I if I sell it to a private Equity Firm or something\\nthey'll they'll be figuring their access strategy as they sign the sign the\\npapers and he said so I've been thinking about a year\\nand he said it isn't that you're such a great guy he says it's just you're the only one left\\nand we bought it and we lived happily ever after and uh that was a man that\\nknew what life was about so with that let's go on to uh Becky\\nthank you this question comes from Don glickstein\\nin Seattle he says Warren has criticized Norfolk Southern's handling of its train derailment yet has been silent about\\nBNSF bnsf's conduct a federal judge ruled in March that BNSF intentionally\\nand illegally violated an easement agreement on tribal land in Washington state by transporting long trains of\\ncrude oil the same month the judge made his ruling a BNSF Train derailed on tribal lands spilling oil in an\\nenvironmentally sensitive area what is Warren doing to ensure that BNSF and other Berkshire subsidiaries fulfilled\\ntheir ethical responsibilities he says he's been a Berkshire owner for more than two decades and he's concerned that\\nBerkshire has no systems to identify and dress what he calls reprehensible Behavior at BNSF and other subsidiaries\\nGarden sure so the uh it it is a valid issue that\\nour team obviously has been dealing with at BNSF we did move uh crude across that\\nuh tribal land we had an agreement that allowed us to move X number of of uh\\nunits per day and we did breach it we went over it there's uh there was some fundamental\\nbreakdowns there in that our team didn't understand the number of of trains that they could move we have had significant\\ndiscussions with the tribe looking to resolve the issue recognizing uh we\\nobviously been benefited from moving those trains and those type of discussions will continue\\num I would say there's Lessons Learned there that we have to when we make a commitment understand what that\\ncommitment is and and live by it or don't assume um we can just\\nmove our trains as we wish or the the cargo as we wish we have to respect those agreements so there's a there's\\nbeen a moment learned there but at the same time we've taken it very seriously and attempted to reach a resolution\\nthere and at some point I I hope we do come to a true resolution that's fair\\nboth to the tribe and to BNSF on the derailment side we did have a an issue\\naround the track derailed we worked very closely with the tribe to mitigate that\\nissue instantly where at least over a very reasonable period of time they were\\nvery responsive our team was very responsive and there were really no long-term environmental impacts to to\\nthat uh to that spill and as our teams highlighted in other comments obviously\\nderailments do occur in the industry we take them incredibly serious they're not all hazardous but irrespective of that\\nwe're constantly looking at how do we prevent them how do we detect them when we\\npotentially have one that's going to occur and what do we do with our trades and then ultimately it comes down to\\nresponding properly because they will occur and I think we have an incredibly dedicated team that's always ready to\\nrespond to the communities uh they're impacting\\nthere are derailments how many how many a year yeah well there's a a thousand\\nplus in the industry the the yeah yeah it's you start hauling\\nright and we're a common carrier we and we take heavy very heavy Freight and we take them at 100 degrees when it's the\\nweather and it's we take it to zero and and we go around curves and we have\\ngrades and uh even a one percent grade if you're going down down\\na hill with I don't know how much weight behind you I mean there's a lot of\\nrailroading is not an easy business and of course the systems were designed you know in the and\\nbasically in the in the late 1800s amid the late 1800s and we have 22\\n000 I think it is miles of track and that doesn't count sightings and some other things it is not an easy business\\nwe'll make mistakes our job we're not making a mistake because we\\nhave a derailment you're gonna we will have the derailments 10 and 20 years or 30 years from now I mean that but\\nwe and we have to carry certain products we wish we didn't have to carry we're a\\ncommon carrier do we like carrying chlorine and ammonia and all no but\\nthey're going to move from one place to another in this society and we are a common carrier and uh we load them and\\nuh if they select our railroad but we are better than we used to be but we\\ngot a long way to go was that fair enough statement absolutely yeah okay station five\\nhi Mr Warren and Miss Manga my name is from China\\ncompany and first of all I'm so excited and very honored to be here today and my\\nquestion is with more and more people focusing on environmental competition\\nprotection and the government supporting the new energy industry as well so what\\nare your thoughts on the continued development of new energy how made the\\nnew energy firm achieve better development in future\\nI think it's the best answer that because he since we bought a company called\\nMid-American but now called Berkshire Hathaway energy but he's been talking about a yearly preparing reports hoping\\nthat we can help solve a number of the problems and we probably spent more money than any utility um I would guess\\nin the United States and uh and we've just scratched the surface but it is not\\neasy when you cross state lines I mean it's uh uh you have different jurisdictions\\nand we should this country should be ahead of word is in terms of transmission and uh\\nwe have been the biggest factor in helping that uh but why don't you tell them a little bit about it sure things\\nweren't so there's no question there's an energy transformation going on around\\nthe globe and and as Warren touched on in the U.S and in some ways I would hope\\nin here in the U.S it would be um we'd at least have a a clear plan\\nAcross the Nation as to how to uh approach that but the reality is it is state by state uh with some exceptions\\nbut so as a result when you think of Berkshire Hathaway energy we we own uh three uh U.S utilities\\nthere and and they'll participate in multiple States but they're developing plans state by state and then trying to\\nintegrate them across the the various States the the opportunities are\\nsignificant because there is a transformation going on uh We've outlined our goal on on where we're\\ngoing relative to carbon at bhe where they'll buy 20 30 reduce their carbon\\nfootprint by uh 50 relative to 2005 so that's the Paris Accord and the standard\\nthey want to hold the the utility industry or the utility companies too and and we're well on that path but to\\nachieve it is a true Journey uh I've often talked to Warren when we bought Pacific warp back in the mid 2000s we\\nimmediately recognized uh to build a lot of renewable energy like we've been\\ndoing in the midwest in Iowa but that was basically in a single stay eight now Pacific Corp were in Six States we\\nstarted that in the back in the mid 2000s here we are and we laid out a great transmission plan here's how we're\\ngoing to build it here's how we're gonna uh effectuate it and all the benefits for our customers over that period of\\ntime here we are in 2023 and we have a little more than a third of that at the\\ntime it was a six billion dollar transmission project today we have a little more than a third of it built and\\nwe've spent probably closer to seven billion dollars and it's the right outcome it's still a great outcome for\\nour customers but that transmission you absolutely as part of the transformation you absolutely have to build it to\\nremove to move all that renewable energy and that's sort of the complexity Warren was highlighting it is a uh you you\\ncan't just wake up one day and and solve this problem you start with transmission and then you build the resources but at\\nthat same same company and if we look at what we're doing across BH G Energy and\\nthat energy transformation we have 70 billion dollars of known\\nprojects that are really required to properly serve our customers and Achieve\\nthat type of energy uh transformation across those utilities and that and\\nthat's in the coming next in the coming 10 years so um we have a team that's absolutely up\\nto the challenge they're delivering on their commitments and it's a very uh very good business opportunity for for\\neach of our companies and for our shareholders because as we deploy that Capital we obviously are in a return on\\nEquity of it so um but it will be a long journey it it have it'll happen over an extended\\nperiod of time and then and the further you get out there the more dependent more dependent upon the uh the evolution\\nof a variety of technologies that are progressing but not there yet so you\\nyou've raised a question I want to just take an extra minute on because it's so important and and I don't really know\\nwhether our form of government um is ideal at all in terms of solving uh\\nthe problem you describe we have solved it one time in World War II we took a\\ncountry that was semi-lumping along and we found ourselves\\nin a World War and what we did in a World War is we brought a bunch of people to\\nWashington at a dollar a year you know whether it was Sydney Weinberg of Goldman Sachs you just name him\\nand we gave them enormous power to\\nreorient the resources of the United States to face the problem that they\\nfaced which was to create a war machine and what they did was they found Henry\\nKaiser you know and told them to build ships and they went to the Ford Motor Company and said you build thanks and\\nsome airplanes and they they reordered the industrial\\nEnterprise of the United States in a way that was unbelievable because they had the power of the federal government\\nand they had the ingenuity of American Business and they had the facilities of American Business\\nand it led to very successful outcome but can we do that in a peacetime where\\nyou've got 50 50 states and you'll have to get them to cooperate and you don't\\nhave anyone that you can you can issue orders but you can't you can't designate where the capital\\ngoes as the other end and you know we try and do it with tax incentives and all that sort of thing but we haven't we\\nhaven't created the unity of purpose and the Machinery that worked in World War\\nII were essentially everybody felt that one job was to win the war and we\\nfigured out how to use our industrial capacity to uh in fact defeat\\nthe Axis powers and uh how do you recreate that uh\\nuh with the present democratic system I I'm not sure I know the answer but I sure know\\nthe problem but um and I think that it\\nif you can think of a if you've got an emergency on your hand you really need\\nto re-engineer the engineer Energy System the United States I don't think I\\ndon't think you can do it uh without something resembling the Machinery the urgency\\nwhatever the capital is there the people are there\\nuh the the objective is obvious and uh uh we just don't seem to be able\\nto do it in a peacetime where where they're used to following a given set of\\na procedure and uh and you know\\nChina's got one country and we've got we've got 50 states and we've got a\\nwhole different system of government that that we should be up to the test but so far it hasn't worked but uh so thank you\\nfor the question Becky this question comes from Chris freed in\\nPhiladelphia he says we know that Greg Abel and Ajit Jain are the next generation of Berkshire leaders who are\\ncurrently behind Greg and Ajit in their prospective roles respective\\nwell that will be the question that they give their well\\nGreg will be have some things extraordinary circumstances but but he's going to\\nsucceed me and then he will have be sitting in a position\\nwhere he needs his equivalent or something close to the corner because\\nhe's better at many things than I've been uh he will need that substitute and when\\nthe when the question comes word we know ajit's opinion on that uh and\\nbut Greg will probably be the one that will make make the final decision I mean it says it was his responsibility and\\nAjit will give him his best advice and I think the others are very very very high\\nwould follow it so but it's not those are not easy\\nquestions it isn't like we've everybody talks about the executive bench and all\\nof that sort of thing which is baloney I mean you know it uh they don't have that many people\\nthat can run five the largest gap net worth\\ncompany and all kinds of diverse businesses uh but you don't need five people either\\nand you need a lot of good operating managers and you need somebody at the top that allocates capital and make sure\\nthat you've got the right operating manager and we've designed design something where we separate\\nthe insurance and the rest of the business and I think it's a very good design but they would\\nnot be smart we wouldn't miss Martin name that decision\\nnow about the two different different uh areas of the business\\nbecause a lot can change between now and then and the most likely changes that this job changes\\nCharlie I I got nothing to add\\nwe have a lot of good people that have risen and the Berkshires and City areas\\nand there's a reason why our operations have by and large done better than other big\\nconglomerate comedies and one of them is that is that we change managers\\nway less frequently than other people do and that's helped us\\nwhen Paul Andrews died we know we know who he thought should take over there but there wasn't\\nany reason to to announce that I mean that Paul Anders would I wish he'd lived to be a hundred\\nwe had we had one of our managers die not long ago in the how old was he at Karen yeah mid 90s\\nSeymour yeah say more away from the scene and Seymour I wrote him a letter when he was 80 and\\nI said you know I'm about your 80 and I'll write you again when you're 90. and uh I wrote him\\nagain one of his 90. he didn't make it to 100 but but he had a terrific\\nuh fellow following him and it really Managed IT jointly to some extent as the\\nyears went by but it's Case by case and the main thing to\\ndo is have the right person running the whole place okay\\nstation six good morning\\nmy name is I'm from Miyazaki Japan\\nI was one of the 8 000 employees at Solomon Brothers that you saved I was\\nyounger back then I was working at seven World Trade Center I've always always wanted to thank you in person for saving\\nthe company it's in police including myself and my family so thank you Mr\\nBuffett thank you\\nand and and thank Derek thank Derek mon who actually had been over in Japan before that and who I met for the first\\ntime the day before I put him in and he turned out to it wouldn't have it wouldn't work if Derek hadn't come so\\nwhatever you taught him in Japan thank you thank you sir now my question\\ntime at the time you have reminded us to not bet against America\\nwhat do you think are the most important things for U.S to remain strong and on\\nthe risk side if the strength of the country is undermined what could be the\\nreasons well we've had we've had a lot of tests\\nI mean we're such a young country you know when you think about Japan and you think about the United States it's just\\nincredible how new we are to the block I mean you know what what are we here 234 years old\\nsince since we started that that's that's that's nothing I mean you know\\nCharlie and I combined are two-thirds of people have two-thirds of the life of the country so and I mean it really has I mean we've\\nwe've been tested at 46 national elections but and and we made some bad choices we got a Civil\\nWar I mean it so the country is that an enormous advantages though in\\nsome way because we started with one half of one percent of the world's population in 1790 and we now have\\nsomething close to 25 percent of the world's GDP and it wasn't because we had some\\nincredible advantage in terms of the line it was nice to have two oceans oceans on each\\nside back when when uh people tried to rule the rule the world by ruling the waves but it\\nyou know and we've had good neighbors in Canada and Mexico but\\nit's a miracle and you say how do we keep the good parts of the system\\nwhile calling out our obvious defects and we do it in a very herky-jerky matter but\\nnet the United States it was a better place to live\\nbut almost when I was born by a huge Factor I mean I just got a root canal a week\\nago and I was just thinking I don't know who even invented nobody came but I'm for\\nhim you know I mean but in a million ways I mean you can\\nroll you can romanticize about the past but forget it uh it it is it is work but\\nnow we do have an atom bomb and we've we wish nuclear power yeah you know we wish\\nthe item had never been split but but uh it has been and you can't put it back in the bottle so the challenges are huge\\nour government always looks you know my dad was in Congress back in\\nthe 1940s and it looked like a mess then you know it all it was unified by the war to some\\ndegree but it was still very partisan now the problem we have I think\\nis that partisanship it seems to be his move toward tribalism\\nand tribalism just doesn't work as well I mean when it gets to tribalism you don't even hear\\nthe other side and tribalism can lead to mobs I mean it just it it flows I mean\\nyou've seen it all splurious we've seen it to a degree here so\\nwe we have to refine in a certain way\\nour democracy as we go along we deal with the world we live in but if I still have a choice of any post\\nto be born in the in the world I'd want to be born in the United States and I'd want to be born today I mean it's a it is a\\nit is a better world than we've ever had and with present-day Communications we can also\\nsay associate seem much more how terrible it is in many ways and it's got problems when I was born in\\n1930 there were two billion people in the world and now there's maybe 7.7 billion and\\ngrowing and we went Millennium with really no\\nchange in population so we and of course we've introduced energy into\\nuh in an incredible way into something where\\nwe now have 7.7 billion people using way more energy than they did when I was born when there\\nwere two billion people so it's it's an exciting world it's a\\nchallenging world and I you know I don't know the solutions on things I do think that we do need to think about different\\nsolutions in terms of how we get important problem solved and that we don't kid\\nourselves that something magic will happen or that everybody will get\\ntogether and we'll all just cheer and then go away by 2050 or anything it uh\\nand how well we adapt to them we will see I would say\\nso far it doesn't look very promising but then I'm sure that when Lincoln looks at it\\nwhat was going on in the Civil War didn't look very promising either so I think that the US is capable of doing\\nremarkable things and I think wouldn't surprise me if they do it again Charlotte Charlie May are you\\nwell I'm slightly less optimistic than warranty\\nI think the best wrote ahead to human happiness as expect\\nless I think it's going to get I think it's going to get tougher and I think the solution of having\\na huge proportion of the young and brilliant people all the way into Wealth Management\\nis a crazy development in terms of its natural consequences for American\\ncivilization we don't need as many wealth managers as we have\\nyou wouldn't but Charlie was born on January 1st 1924. and\\nyou'd hate to go back to that one Detroit yes I would and I I I like more wealth managers who were just merely\\nreflecting the fact there's more wealth but we've got I don't like everybody going into wealth\\nmanagement or MIT or something it's I think the world's a little crazy now\\ntake your choice okay Becky\\nthis question comes from Dennis degennaro as Warren stated in the 2022 annual\\nreport Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash in U.S treasury bills it will also avoid behavior that could\\nresult in any uncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times including Financial panics and unprecedented\\nInsurance losses after Warren passes away his a shares will be converted into B shares and\\ndistributed to various foundations these foundations will then sell the shares to fund their causes Warren estimates it\\nwill take 12 to 15 years for all his shares to be sold I worry that a corporate Raider like Carol icon or a\\ngroup will buy up enough of these shares to take control of Berkshire and completely disregard Warren's philosophy of holding a lot of cash in U.S treasury\\nbills and instead be greedy Reckless and highly speculative and ruin berkshire's\\nposition as a rock solid Financial Fortress I also worry that changes might be made in how Berkshire subsidiaries\\nare run do Warren and Charlie worry that these things could happen well I think it's fair to say we think\\nabout a plenty but I don't I don't I don't I don't worry enormously if we\\nit is true that that uh Greg and the directors will have a\\nhoneymoon period for a long time because simply because uh of the boats that will\\nstill remain I mean it and and uh but it's true that eventually they won't\\nget judged based on how well our operation fairs versus others now if\\nwe don't pay any dividends and in 12 or 15 years you're talking a trillion and a half\\nthat it would take to take over and and uh I think if we can't\\nthat that limits the group they like to think about how much they can borrow against it it doesn't work when you uh\\nand and some of these there's nobody to come close to doing it\\nthemselves and I think that the important thing is that Berkshire\\nregarded the be regarded as a National Asset rather than a national liability\\nwe've got to be a plus to the country with our form of operation we certainly have got a record\\nwhich will then be 12 or 15 years longer done\\nwith much more Capital more companies more things will have happened where our\\nhundreds of billions can work its way into the economy in terms of lots of\\njobs lots of products loss of behavior and it can be compared with other things so I\\nI I think we went out of if we deserved to win out and I think uh I think the\\nodds of that happening are very very very high Charlie\\nwell we I don't spend much time worrying about something's going to happen 50 years ago\\nand ever I'm dead I I think you sort of take care of each\\nday's responsibilities pretty well and think ahead as well as you can\\nand you just take the results as they fall so I'm I'm philosophical\\nbut I I'm not I'd be spreading unnecessarily\\nokay neither one of us are worried basically uh but we but but we plan we do plan and\\nand you know I've got a model in my mind of what Berkshire has been that model has gotten\\nit's been modified plenty of times over 58 years the one thing I know initially is or very quickly was it shouldn't be a\\ntextile company that was that was an important decision and and I mean we've just played the hand as a as it come\\nalong and and we made a few really good decisions and we will never make a decision that\\nkills us they only things that are a threat to the planet we don't have any answer for those but\\nwe do we keep ourselves in better shape than anybody else that and we just\\naren't going to have big maturities of debt that come along we aren't going to\\nhave uh insurance policies and be can be cashed in that mass and we will sit with\\nthe Lord what looks like a huge among the capital and but it is a huge amount of capital but there's a huge amount of\\nearning power there's a huge amount of diversity everything so our business model\\nwill be graded and it'll be graded against a lot of a lot of people that\\nwe'd like to be graded against so uh I think we're handling something very\\nsecure over to the Future and I think we've got the shareholder base like nobody has I\\nmean there isn't anybody in the country that I know of unless they've had a shareholder an employee-owned company\\nprior to going public or something of the sort but but this is the product of you know the\\n58 years of of regarding the shareholder as the owner\\nof the company but what does that mean that means having happy customers it means being it\\nbeing means being welcomed by your community rather than having them turn you away it means\\nthat the government feels better with you if there's a financial crisis because you're\\nyou can provide something that actually the company the country can't under some circumstances and you'll be there and if\\nit may and same time it'll be good for the business uh and we will have crises\\nof one sort or another but if they aren't challenging the planet which\\nworries you in terms of some of the threats that we have learn\\nwon't be a plus to the United States and if we're close to the United States Will Will Survive\\nokay station Seven\\nMr Buffett and Mr Munger thank you for having us this weekend\\nmy name is Beau Clayton and I'm from Durham North Carolina\\none of the reasons that we are all here is that your great storytellers\\nand we carry those stories back home with us can you please share a couple stories\\nthat maybe we haven't heard before about Mr Abel and Mr Jane\\nthat capture their character and their caliber as leaders\\n[Applause] I'll start out with the Jeep\\nhe walked into the office and 1986 and I'd gotten the bright idea of\\ngoing into the reinsurance business I think in maybe 1969 so I'd stumbled along\\nuh for 17 years and it a wonderful guy that rather\\nuh uh but he also liked certain Brokers and\\nI mean he was running at the traditional wave taco\\ntop quality and everything else but but uh but he fell into he\\nhe didn't try and change the system he tried to improve the system and to some\\ndegree and we just we went nowhere 17 17 years\\nwandering around in the wilderness when I thought I was um I knew we could have something good\\nand then the G came in on a Saturday and uh uh Mike Goldberg and\\nstirred him in I think and Mike deserves to be enshrined and perpetuity act and I\\ntalked with him a while I think maybe I was opening the mail on Saturday while I talked with him and and he had\\nabsolutely zero experience with with insurance but it actually seen a good bit of how\\nCorporate America operated because it has been a management consulting and\\nafter talking with him I I knew I'd struck over and uh\\nso I hired him and gave him the backing of some money\\nuh and we had a very good period in the market almost right away for him to act\\nand and the Jeep uh you know if I had the\\ntop pick of 10 Insurance managers in the world I'm I I could take all ten and they wouldn't\\nyou can't replace a Jeep and uh we still\\nenjoy talking I don't we don't talk as frequently as he used to but we used to talk about every day\\nbut he is he's one of a kind and\\nyou know what if they're going to stick around long enough you only need one of a kind Paul Andrews stuck around a TT\\nhad all the money in the world every time I talk to him about getting a raise or something of the sort he said\\nwe'll talk about that next year I just he was not what you get when you get the top draft picks from the leading\\nBusiness Schools and I will say this I have never looked at where anybody went to school\\nin terms of of hiring I mean I I just somebody mailed me a resume or something I don't\\ncare where they went to school uh uh and it just so happens that\\nthat uh actually went to some pretty good schools but he isn't a g because he went to the schools and uh\\nCharlie didn't tell a story or two um how'd you find Louis vincenti\\nAlly well he was there I I but you got to recognize him I asked\\nLouie once how he managed to play first string football at I think Stanford\\nwhen he only weighed 165 pounds and he said well I said I was pretty\\nquick and he was pretty quick but\\nwe have found a lot of people within our companies who were pretty quick it's it's a\\nyeah we had we had one guy that quit at fourth grade didn't in Ben Rosner Am I Wrong oh yeah totally self-educated\\nBen Rosner knew more about retailing and difficult neighborhoods and anybody and\\nhe watched everything in his business like a hawk and he was a he was amazing\\nnow there was an example we never found anybody who could do what when Ben died that bill I don't know he\\nleft us yeah and you want a story it's kind of interesting because Ben Rosner\\nhad a partner Leo Simon and Lisa Leo Simon was uh Moe\\nannenberg's son-in-law and Leo therefore\\nis very very very wealthy and uh and then started with nothing but\\nthey they liked each other and one time well before they got in\\nvolved in the in the business uh the business we bought but they got\\nthe idea of buying a submarine from World War One\\nand taking it to the century of progress or the World's Fair in effect in Chicago\\nI think in 1933 so they bought the submarine for not probably nothing and they figured you\\nknow the average guy from Walmart was going to his first World's Fair get a submarine for a\\nquarter or something that they'd pay it so they hauled it from Florida wherever they got they\\nhauled it to Chicago and then they got into Chicago and they're hauling a submarine down the\\nstreets of Chicago and it was creating traffic problems like nobody could\\nimagine so a cop came over and he said\\nto Ben he said what do you think you guys are going with a submarine and Ben says he\\nsays well he says you'll have to talk to my partner Mr Capone [Laughter]\\njust keep going and that was that was Ben Roger and then Leo Simon died and\\nwhen he died in 1967 or so uh Ben Rosner kept delivering half thee\\nprophets to his widow who was incredibly Rich of course being\\nno annivers first born born daughter I think I think I think Moe had nine\\nnine girls in a row before Walter came along the tenth I may be lost by one but\\nanyway I went to this fancy apartment and anyway\\nthen then kept her in for a half\\nthe deal and he had her signed the rent checks just so she would look like she was doing something in this business\\nand she didn't need the money obviously but he just felt he was obligated once his partner Leo died\\nand then she started criticizing him and at that point then went to her his lawyer\\nwas her lawyer actually will felsteiner I don't know whatever happened to will but he gave me he gave me a call because\\nBen wanted to call me because he wanted me to buy it and he wanted me if I bought it\\nhe'd be rid of the partners ex-partner's wife and uh and he'd get\\nhe had me and Charlie come back and we went to will felsteiner's office\\nand businesses I'll work till the end of the year and that's all but I'll tell you this thing for six million bucks and\\nI had two million in cash and a couple million in real estate and a couple million of operating earnings this is crazy\\nbut he fell over he was getting a lousy prize she was taking a half of the a lovely\\nprice for half the money so uh uh\\nhe looked at me at some point Charlie you described the rest of it again he said I heard here you're the\\nfastest draw in the west he says draw one of the New York lawyer's office yeah\\nand this guy is he's selling he's selling his baby and and he told us he's\\ngoing to leave it I got Charlie on this side I said if if this guy leaves at the end of the year he can throw away every\\npsychology book that's ever been written I mean it isn't going to happening and so we bought it and we lived happily\\never after with Ben and one time he was taking me over to see a property\\nwe had in Brooklyn and uh and along the way I said\\nuh Ben I you know I promised you I wouldn't\\ninterfere in the business when we started and he knew a butt was coming and he just said Thank You Warren and\\nthey're showing him he was a lot of fun we have so many Ben rozen stories but now you've heard one\\nthat hasn't been published before okay Becky this question comes from chai gohil\\nhe writes this is for a G reinsurance industry is going through one of the hardest pricing environments in the last\\n15 years Berkshire historically has participated during these stress times when economic returns are very\\nattractive this year it appears Berkshire has not been interested in deploying its resources towards property\\ncat reinsurance despite such strong returns can you elaborate on reasons for not participating despite these returns\\nand your broader view on how you're planning to shape your reinsurance business post-acquisition of Allegheny\\nin terms of Allegheny that's an easy response we look we treat our operating\\nunits independent of each other and as far as Allegheny is concerned they have a major presence in the reinsurance\\nbusiness under the brand name of transatlantic re that company will operate the way it's\\nbeen operating in the past there'll be no change in terms of strategy or management and they will keep doing what\\nthey're doing they've been very successful and hopefully they'll keep being successful\\nnow in terms of the property CAD business that I have been active in over\\nthese last several years you are right that the last 15 years has been a difficult time prices have not been\\nattractive and even though we have had some presence in the property cat\\nbusiness in the last 15 years it really is been minimal\\nuh this December 31st which is a big renewal date for Cattery insurance we\\nwere hoping that we would get a few days in the Sun and we'd be able to deploy our capital and be able to write some\\nfairly attractive business as it happened towards the end of December till about\\nthe third week of December I was very optimistic that we would get a chance to\\nput several billion dollars on on the books but in the last 10 days of uh December\\nunfortunately a lot of capacity came out of the Woodworks pricing that we were expecting to realize didn't really come\\nand meet our pricing requirements as a result of which January 1 was a big disappointment we did not write as much\\nas we were hoping to write now fast forward to April 1 which is another big\\nrenewal date we had a lot of powder dry and we were lucky that we kept the\\npowder dry because April 1 suddenly prices zoomed up again a lot higher than what they were on January 1 and started\\nto look attractive to us so now we have a portfolio that is very\\nheavily exposed to property catastrophe uh to put that in perspective our exposure today is almost 50 percent more\\nthan what it was uh five six months ago so you know we I think we have written\\nas much as our capacity will allow us to write we are very happy with what we've\\nwritten the margins have been healthy the only thing that I want to mention to\\nyou is that while the margins have been healthy we have a very unbalanced\\nportfolio what that means is if there's a big hurricane in Florida\\nwe will have a very substantial loss as opposed to that if we have a very big\\nloss anywhere other than Florida relative to a competition we will have a\\nmuch smaller loss net net I'm very happy with the portfolio it's been a lot\\nbetter it is a lot better than what it's been in the past uh I don't know how long it'll last and of course\\nif the hurricane happens in Florida we could lose\\nacross all the units we could lose as much as 15 billion dollars and if there\\nisn't a loss we'll make several billion dollars is profit and LG tell them how long when you call\\nme and said you'd like to expose us to whatever was a couple billion more of of\\nexposure how long I took to say yes yeah uh so the way we think about our\\nexposure is you know in in the property in the insurance operations collectively across the entire company uh given that\\nwe have about a little less than 300 billion of capital we think of that as a\\n55 exposure that we're willing to take on so to complete Warren's story\\na few weeks ago we had about 13 billion dollars of exposure all across like uh\\nthe globe and I called up war and I said we're up to 13 it'll be nice if we could go up to 15 that's a good round number\\nand that was less than a 30 second phone call\\nI think Warren said yes without even listening to what the numbers I hope he calls me again\\n[Laughter] okay station eight\\nhello my name is adal Flores and I've been a shareholder for about 16 years and I'm\\ncoming from Guadalajara Mexico my my question is for Warren and Charlie\\ncompanies have the Eternal dilemma between bought Building Products that can make profits and increase their\\ncompany competitive position in the best case you can build products that have both characteristics at the same time\\nlike Google did but most of the time companies need to choose between short-term profits and long-term\\ndefensibility for example Amazon was focused on building their famous Amazon flywheel with limited profits initially\\nin order to abstain obtain stronger Network effects with the hope of getting\\nmore defensible profits in the future when you invest you constantly speak about the importance of building\\ncompetitive modes what advice would you give to CEOs about how to balance this\\ndilemma which is essentially short-term profit versus long-term definitibility thank you\\nwell the answer to control your destiny which we've been able to do it uh Berkshire so\\nwe have we feel no pressure from Wall Street uh\\nyou know we don't have investor calls we don't have to make promises we we get a\\nchance to make our own mistakes and and occasionally find something that that\\nworks well but we recognize that the people in this room and people like them\\nuh are the ones we're working for and we're not working for a bunch of people that that care\\nabout whether we meet the quarter estimate or anything so we have a freedom uh\\nthat we that we get to use and we're interested in men we're interested\\nin owning a wonderful business forever well there aren't very many wonderful businesses but we do learn\\na lot as we go along we we Charlie and I have often mentioned how we learn so much\\nwhen we bought C's candy which we did but we learned when we bought Ben Rogers\\nchain of women's dress shops spread all over the the eastern part of the country\\nuh we learned when we tried them getting into the department store\\nbusiness back in 1966 and as the ink was drying on our purchase price we realized we'd done something\\ndumb but we're we're learning all the time how consumers behave\\nI'm not going to be able to learn the technical aspects of businesses but that\\nyou know that that be nice if I knew it but but it isn't essential and you know\\nwe are obviously uh we've got\\na business at Apple which is larger than our energy business and we may only own\\nFive Points six or seven percent but our ownership goes up every year and I don't\\nunderstand the phone at all but I do understand consumer Behavior\\nand I know how people think about whether to buy a second car I know wow\\nthey go out to different We Own auto dealerships we own we're learning all\\nthe time from all of our businesses how people react to Garanimals versus you\\nknow selling them something else and and so cease was a sort of breakthrough but\\nbut it just we just keep learning uh as to more about how people behave and how\\na good business can turn into a bad business and how some good businesses can maintain uh uh their competitive\\nadvantage over time and and so\\num we don't we don't have some formula the worship\\npeople we just but we can also tell them in 10 seconds whether it's something of\\nInterest I mean with you know when when uh I get these calls and we want to send\\ndecks and all that sort of which is nonsense I mean it uh uh there's a bunch\\nof guys sitting that get paid for drawing up these projections of the future and everything\\nlike that if they knew the future you know we don't know the future but we do know certain kinds of businesses we know\\nwhat the right price is and we know what we think we can project out in terms of consumer Behavior Uh\\nand consumer and threats to a business and and that's what we've\\nbeen about and that's what we'll continue to about we do get we don't get smarter over time we get we\\nget a little wiser though uh following it over time and and you can\\ndo it while sitting in the office with a telephone too which we like Charlie well tell them the story of the Japanese\\ninvestment that that should be told again that that that's that's a nice\\nstory you know well it was pretty simple I mean I you know other\\nback when I started other people were going through Playboy and I was going through Moody so that you know basically\\nand uh uh there's a movie out called Turn every page but which I\\nsaw again for the second time a couple of days ago Lizzie got leaving I recommend everybody in this world watch\\nthat because I turned every page in the past and uh I did it for thousands and\\nthousands of pages and Moody's and I did it at the Department of Public Utilities in in Boston I did a Dan Newton the\\ninsurance department that it just kept turning page as well that that goes on for\\na while but now we need Big Ideas in order to find things and uh and what\\nwas your question Charlie tell them about the Japanese well the Japanese thing was was simple I mean it kind of I\\nlike looking at companies every I mean I like looking at figures about companies and and here\\nwere five very very substantial companies understandable companies\\nmost of them uh maybe all of them we've done business within in a dozen different ways if you\\ngo a couple miles from where this place is the our last coal generating plant\\nwas built by one of the companies that so\\nhere they were they were sitting as a group\\nwhere they were earning will say 14 percent uh on what we were going to pay to buy\\nthem they were paying decent dividends they were going to repurchase shares in some cases\\nthey owned a whole bunch of businesses that we could understand as a group although we didn't mean we had deep\\nunderstanding on anything but we've seen them operate and everything that there wasn't anything to it and at the same time\\nwe could take out the currency risk by financing in in the end\\nand that was going to cost us a half of one percent well if you get 14 on one side a half a percent on the other side\\nand you've got money that you know forever and they're doing intelligent\\nthings and they're sizable so we just started buying them I didn't even probably tell Greg until\\nmaybe six months after we'd gotten going and and then we hit five percent\\nuh in all of them we announced on my birthday and uh at 90th at the we owned\\nover five percent and recently went over for the first time to visit with\\nthem and moved more than pleasantly surprised delighted with what we find there and now we own\\n7.4 percent of them we won't go over 9.9 without their agreeing and we sold\\nanother 164 whatever it is uh\\nbillion of us again would have done for us if we only had five billion dollars\\nor something and it made 10 billion dollars simply in that way yeah we were the\\nheroes now 10 billion just sort of disappears as it's an Old Dot in person's report but it's\\nfun and it is fun and it is 10 billion dollars and Charlie says it keeps\\nand Charlie says it keeps me out of bars right knocked up about it and I probably\\ntalked to Charlie about this app the year after I started but who knows I mean I but I knew he'd like it I mean\\nobviously and and [Music]\\nyeah well not even that quite that much yeah but you know we are four or five billion\\nahead plus dividends and we've got to carry that's terrific and and you know\\nuh and they welcome us and they should welcome us and but we we love it the way they're operating\\nwe're not there to tell them what to do in the least uh uh so\\nwe didn't and but we did say we never go over 9.9 and we mean it and then they they know that\\nwill be true to our word and I went over there partly to introduce Greg to those\\npeople because we're going to be with them 10 20 30 40 years from now and\\nthey may occasionally find something that we can do jointly and they look they look forward to doing that we look\\nforward to it and uh in addition we have some other operating businesses in Japan\\nso Greg do you have anything the only thing I would add is that one\\nhas one you went over there it was to build the build the trust with these\\nJapanese companies because we do hope there's long-term opportunities but fundamentally as you highlighted uh\\nthey're an incredible uh they've been a very good investment I'd also highlight the five meetings we had we're really\\nquite remarkable I mean these companies the culture and the history around it and how proud they are you know there's\\njust moments of learning from them so it was it was just a great experience to to spend really two days with the five\\ncompanies and an issue that we intended to be 56 billion of Yen that we were issuing and\\nselling turned out to be 164.4 or something like that everything everything's worked so well\\nand as Charlie says it you know it doesn't move 500 billion of\\nnet worth that much but this one is you know it will keep\\nadding over the years to the berkshire's value with this one\\nvery widespread probably four or five hundred million dollars a year and uh\\nyou know we'll just keep looking for more opportunities and and Japan we have\\nbursure is the largest borrower outside of corporate borrower side of\\nJapan that that exists and we didn't said how to be that but it's it's turned\\nout that way and and we're not done I mean it uh you know in terms of\\nwhat may come along there and uh we have some direct operations there as\\nI mentioned that the uh and we've got some\\nreally wonderful Partners working for us and I don't have to do anything [Laughter]\\nokay Becky the next question comes from Ellie Amin Tibet\\nwho asks during an episode of investing the Templeton way podcast Professor\\ndamodaran who he respects almost as much as Warren and Charlie mentioned that he\\nis not comfortable with positions becoming a large part of his portfolio for example when they reach 25 to 35\\npercent he mentioned that apple is now 35 percent of berkshire's portfolio and\\nthinks that that is near a danger zone wonders if Warren and Charlie can comment I believe we made one comment\\nfirst but Charlie will come up with I think he thought it was mine yeah\\napple is not 35 percent of of Berkshire portfolio bursters portfolio includes\\nthe railroad the energy business or animals you name it See's Candy they're\\nall businesses and uh you know the the good thing about Apple\\nis that we we can go up they buying their stocking instead of owning 5.6 percent\\nyou know they got down to they got about 15 billion 700 and some million shares\\noutstanding they get down to 15 and a quarter billion without us doing anything we've got six percent so we\\ncan't own more than 100 of the NSF we can't own more than 100 of Garanimals or\\nSee's candy and it'd be nice we'd love it on 200 but\\nthat just isn't doable but they're all the same they're good businesses and to\\nthink that our Criterion a criteria for\\napple is different than the other businesses we own it just happens to be A Better Business than any we own and we\\nput a fair amount of money in it but we haven't got more money in it than we've got in the railroad and apple is a\\nBetter Business our railroad is a very good business but it's not remotely as good as Apple's business but uh uh Apple\\nyou know has a position with consumers where they're paying\\nyou know maybe the paid 1500 bucks or whatever it may be for a phone\\nand these same people pay 35 000 for having a second car and if they had to give up a second car\\nor give up their iPhone they'd give up their second car I mean it's it's an extraordinary probably we don't have\\nanything like that but we own 100 of but we're very very very happy to have 5.6\\nor whatever it may be percent and we're delighted every tenth of a percent that goes up it's like adding 100 million\\ndollars to our earnings I mean our share of the earnings and they use their earnings to buy out\\nour partners which we're glad to see them sell out so the index funds have to sell they bring the\\nnumber of shares down and uh you know I'm good we went up slightly\\nlast year and I made a mistake a couple of years ago and I sold some shares when I had\\ncertain certain reasons why\\ngames were useful to take that year from a tax standpoint but\\nhaving heard having heard me say that it was a dumb decision uh and uh\\nuh Charlie you've already given your comment about it but but we do not have\\n35 percent of berkshire's portfolio berkshire's portfolio is the funds we have to work\\nwith and we want to own good businesses and we also want to have plenty of liquidity and beyond that\\nyou know the sky's the limiter or are mistakes who knows what the bottom is\\nCharlie do you want to add anything to your earlier comment well\\nI think one of the inane things that's taught in\\nmodern University education is it a vast diversification is absolutely mandatory and investing in\\nCommon Stocks that is an insane idea it's not that easy to have a vast\\nplethora of good opportunities that are easily identified and if you've only got three I'd rather\\nbe in my best ideas instead of my worst and\\nnow some people can't tell their best ideas from their worst in in the act of\\ndeciding the investment already is good they they get the thing it's better than\\nit is I think we make fewer mistakes like that than other people and that is a blessing\\nto us we're not so smart but we kind of know where the edge of our smartness is\\nthat is a very important part of practical intelligence and a lot of\\npeople who are geniuses on IQ tests think they're a lot smarter than they are and what they are is dangerous\\nand and but but if you know the edge of your own ability pretty well you should\\nignore most of the Notions of our experts about what I call dehorsification of\\nportfolios okay\\nyeah [Applause]\\nsession nine\\nhi Charlotte hi Charlie and Warren thank you for this superb uh shareholder meeting celebration\\nmy name is David Chung from Hong Kong and a proud graduate of Chicago Booth\\nI'm also here with my two sons Aiden and Ashen who's currently studying University of Chicago as a freshman and\\nsophomore this is my second time attending the conference last being 2019 four years\\nago which I was only a guest shareholder of my friend Andrew so after the shareholder meeting I have\\ndecided to buy into Berkshire Hathaway which has given me a great return of 62\\nsince 2019. so I want to thank you for that [Applause]\\nI have also taken one of your advice to give my children a share for each of\\ntheir birthdays although they want a Berkshire Hathaway eight shares\\nthey will do just fine with P shares\\nmy question is how do you see the current U.S China\\ninternet companies valuation and the price disparity given there has been many uncertainties\\nsuch as geopolitical tensions significant course optimizations with\\nlean at U.S tech firms while China attack has been through all that already\\nthank you Charlie I wanna well\\nthere's been some tension in the economic relationship of\\nthe United States and China I think that that tension\\nhas been wrongly created on both sides I think we're equally guilty of being stupid\\nthere's one thing we should do let's get along with China and we should have a lot of free trade\\nwith China in our mutual interest\\nand I just can't imagine\\nit's just so obvious there's so much safety and so much creativity that's\\npossible think of what Apple has done by engaging in a\\npartnership with China as a big supplier yeah it's been good for apple and good for\\nChina that's the kind of business we'll be doing with China and more of it and\\nwith everything that increases the tension between the two companies is stupid stupid and all at least stopped\\non each side and each side ought to respond to the other side stupidity with\\nreciprocal kindness that's my view and it creates one enormous problem of\\ncourse which is that you have the two superpowers of the world and they know they have to\\nget along with each other either one can destroy the other and they're going to be competitive with\\neach other uh but part of it is trying always in a game like that is\\ntrying to judge how far you can push the other guy without them reacting wrong and uh\\nyou know if either side is a bullying some ways they can get away with it to\\nan extent because the alternative is would drive them both into destruction\\nbut if they push it too far they increase the probability that something really does go wrong so it's a\\nyou know it's one of those Game Theory dilemmas but you really need\\nthe leader of both countries uh and you need the\\npopulace to understand at least the general situation in which these countries are\\ngoing to operate over the next century and know that that some leader that\\npromises too much couldn't get you in a hell of a lot of trouble and that like you know that\\nyou've got one kind of a system that gets this leader one way and you've got another system that gets his leader another way\\nand keeping keeping either aside from trying to play\\nthe game too hard uh and thinking the other side will\\nwill go along you know it's like playing checking you\\nknow and driving toward a cliff so it is if you've got any diplomacy skills\\npersuasive skills or anything like that you really want people that will\\nconvince the other country as well as his own or her own country\\nthat that this is what we're engaged in we've got to do it right we won't give away the\\nstory but we won't try and take the whole story either and and it it we we're just at the beginning of\\nthis uh unfortunately I mean we've learned what the situation was it used\\nto be the Soviet and mutually assured destruction\\nwas our policy then and that kept a lot of things from happening\\nbut it also came with a very very very close call uh with Cuba and\\nthese are not you know these are different games than existed hundreds of years ago you could\\nyou know Britain might rule the Caesar France or Spain but but now you're playing with a game that\\nyou can't really make a huge mistake in and I think that\\nthat should be the better that's understood in both countries\\nthe more the leaders feel that their citizenry does understand that\\nthe better off we'll be and that a lot of\\nthe the the uh demography or the a lot of\\na lot of inflammatory speaking but a lot of authoritarian action I mean it all\\ncarries its dangers and the world was stumbled through\\nthe years post 1945 with a lot of close calls from the\\nin the nuclear Arena and now we've got pandemics and we've got\\nwe've got cyber and a whole bunch of other things so we've got more tools of Destruction\\nthe world's ever had and it it's imperative that\\nChina and the United States both understand what the game is and\\nunderstand that you can't push too hard but we're getting but both places are going to be competitive and both can\\nprosper that's that's what really is that's that's the vision\\nthat is out there that China will have a more wonderful country\\nthe United States will have a more wonderful country and and and the two\\nare not just compatible they're almost imperative uh in terms of\\nuh what's going to happen in the next 100 years or so and uh\\nuh I think that the leaders of both countries have got\\nan important job and and having that understood\\nand not to do inflammatory things and we'll see whether\\nthe locks that has taken us from 1945 to present holds out and and I think we can affect\\nto some extent that luck and without sure a message we will move\\nto Becky uh this question comes from Rohit bellany Berkshire bought a substantial\\nposition in Taiwan semiconductor and contrary to its normal holding timeline sold almost the entire position within a\\nfew short months while you cited in a CNBC interview that geopolitical issues were the Catalyst these issues were\\nseemingly no different when you acquired that stock so what else if anything changed in those few months and prompted\\nThe Firm to offload close to five billion dollars worth of Taiwan semiconductor shares\\nat Taiwan semiconductor is one of the best managed companies\\nand important companies in the world and uh\\nuh there is not and I think you'll be able to say the\\nsame thing 5 or 10 or 20 years from now I don't like its location and and uh\\nreevaluated that I mean I don't think it should be any place but Taiwan although they will be obviously opening them\\nship capacity in this country and actually one of our subsidiaries that we got in Allegheny is is uh is\\nparticipating in in in their Arizona uh construction activities but uh\\nit's uh it uh\\nit's a question of we would rather have the same\\nkind of company in there there's nobody in the chip company there's no in the chip industry that's in their league in\\nour bit at least in my view uh and the man that was a 91 year old or so\\nthat connected with us and that I think I played Bridge with him and uh uh in\\nAlbuquerque and The Marvelous people marvelous company but\\nI'd rather find a marvelous people I won't find it in the chip industry but marvelous people and\\nmarvelous uh competitive position and everything I'd rather find it in the United States\\nI feel better about the capital that we've got deployed\\nin Japan than in Taiwan it uh I wish I weren't so but I think that's a\\nreality and I've reevaluated that uh in the light of certain things that were going on try well my view is that Warren\\nought to feel comfortable if he wants to yeah\\nput that in the minutes okay station 10.\\nfirst of all thank you for making our lives better my name is bogumil Baranowski I'm a\\nfounding partner of sika's associ New York we manage multi-generational family\\nfortunes hence my question Mr Buffett in 1976 in your tribute to\\nBenjamin Graham you wrote Walter lippman spoke of men who plant trees that other\\nmen will sit under Ben Graham was such a man you're both\\nsuch people could you share with us your 100 Year vision for Berkshire it's a question to\\nyou both yeah I would like to add one thing about Ben Graham ah\\nBen Graham didn't all kinds of things for me and I never expected one thing in\\nreturn I mean it just you name it and he did it and and there wasn't any hidden\\nyou know there's a hint I should say of of anything expected in return and uh\\nI I checked uh Bobby he wrote a book in 1949\\nthat in a sense said to me in very persuasive terms\\nthat what I'd been spending the previous\\neight or nine years working at and loving was all wrong\\nand uh that book has been I check it every now and then\\non Amazon to where it ranks and you know Amazon ranks hundreds and hundreds and\\nhundreds of thousands of books uh by sales and\\nBen Graham's book has been up there like number 300 or 350 or something like that\\nforever and there isn't there isn't any book like that I wrote Harper columns and note the other day\\nbecause they're bringing out another Edition and I asked him how many copies have been sold and they said the records\\ndidn't go back far enough but they they they had 7.3\\nmillion copies of this little book that changed my life\\nand uh uh continues to I'll sell every investment book\\ninvestment groups come along and you know their number 400 or a thousand or something for a\\nwhile and then all of a sudden they're numbered 25 000 or 200 000 and and this this book\\nyou know in how many areas can you find any book\\nthat has had that sustained position you can't you go back and look at number one in 1950 or number two or number three\\nand you're looking in 51 and 52 they don't continue I mean they just don't continue uh\\ncookbooks maybe one or two of them last for a while but there is nothing and\\nthis book lives on and everybody keeps bringing out new books and saying a lot of other things but they aren't saying\\nanything it's as important as what he said in 1949 in this relatively thin little book so uh\\nyou know our vision for Berkshire is exactly what we said today we we want\\nit to be a company that is owned by shareholders and behaves in\\na way that Society is happy that it exists and not unhappy\\nand we will have unlimited capital we'll get lots of talent\\nand we've got a base that can't be beat and and there's no\\nreason why it can't be perpetuated just like Ben's book and maybe be an example of\\nother people and and if so we'll be very happy Charlie\\nyeah one of the really interesting things about he was a really gifted teacher a very honorable profession\\nand that is what has lasted however\\nan interesting fact that he was sheepish about in his old age was that more than half of all the\\ninvestment returned that Betty Graham made in his whole life came from one stock one growth stock Geico\\nbirchers subsidiary and he at the time he operated there were a\\nlot of sort of lousy companies that were too cheap and you could make a little money floating from one to another\\nbut the big money he made was one growth stock buying one undervalued great\\ncompany is a very good thing his Berkshire has found out again and again and again\\nand and Ben wrote a post trip to the 49 Edition\\npointing out exactly that fact and acknowledging it but said but also took the some good lessons from\\nit you know he said that's the way life is that that you prepare and you\\nyou know it don't lose everything along the way and then something comes along and Geico came along because\\na banker in Fort Worth at a financial Leo Davidson uh\\nand I think the banker got three quarters of it and I don't mean Leo Davis and Leo Goodwin uh who founded\\nGeico then called government employees insurance company and you can figure out the acronym and uh\\nthe deal almost fell apart the deal was as I remember from maybe a million and a\\nhalf or something like a million and a quarter and it almost fell apart because of a difference of twenty five thousand\\ndollars in the net worth delivered this is a businesses you know we're tens of billions I mean\\nbut he pointed out the irony in that too I mean it he was honest about it was\\ntotally intellectually honest on about us about his the failings and but also the strengths\\nof his approach and he and that to some extent you know Charlie and I have seen\\nthat in our lives I mean the sort of the prepared mind the willingness the to act when you need to act and the\\nwillingness to ignore it every salesman in the world and and the imperative to the norm and uh\\nis one or two things that make the right decision if you make the right decision on a spouse I mean you've won the game\\nthey you know and there's enormous important decision and got all the time\\nI mean in the world we got more time now than used to have one of them again to make that decision and and uh\\nyou know I don't know whether a third or whatever percentage below that one you\\nknow it it is it is really interesting the thing to do is just\\nkeep trying to try and think things through not do too many stupid things and\\nand sooner or later you have a Lollapalooza Charlotte would say\\nokay Becky all right this question comes from terrafter a shareholder in Sierra Vista\\nArizona who is asking a question of Ajit wants to know about electric vehicles\\ngetting insurance from the manufacturer instead of car insurance companies a recent article in the Wall Street\\nJournal shows that though EVS are a small but growing percentage of sales Tesla and GM are offering their own\\nElectric Vehicle Insurance what will Geico do to combat this\\nyeah so Geico is talking to a number of original equipment manufacturers as well\\nto try and see how best they can work with the auto manufacturer and offer\\ninsurance at the point of sale uh they haven't been very many success stories as yet\\nuh so we'll wait and see uh you know clearly it is a very convenient way to\\nsell auto insurance at the point of sale but there's a there's a fair amount of\\ndata that needs to be collected on the driver not just the car and that makes it a little more complicated so we are\\ntalking to some auto manufacturers ourselves we are hopeful to that we will\\nstrike a deal with some of them before not too long Tesla has made and GM they both have\\ntalked a lot in the press in terms of getting into their insurance business and in fact GM I think has projected\\nthey'll write three billion dollars of Premium which you know it's hard to imagine where it'll come from but\\nthey're all hot to trot I think somebody will find the secret sauce before not too long and we ourselves are in that\\nrace yeah I would I would point out that General Motors Motors insurance\\nfor decades and I mean this is not a new idea and uh\\nUber or a lot of insurance for a while they laid it off with somebody and that\\ncompany got killed by it but I and I don't know the deal between Uber and forget the name of the company that took\\nit on the Jeep would probably know but yeah yeah and you know it\\nthere's there's nothing it is not it's not a new idea it's not magic in the least I mean it is hard\\nto come up with something that is better at missing Max and matching risk to\\nreward uh wrist wrist I'm sorry risk surprise then then uh a bunch of very smart\\npeople are doing it a progressive and a bunch of very smart people are doing it\\nit is it's just it was fascinating to me one Uber went into it you know and they were\\ngoing to get their head handed to them but they laid off a good bit of it and very very substantial percentage of it\\nwas somebody else who got their head and she was like and uh you know and but it was a story you know Wall Street loves\\nit and uh uh I with we've got\\nad car dealerships that do a lot of business uh and\\nyou know we've got some people buying the car and the place and and we form an insurance company around the\\ngroup for some reason that writes Insurance you know it it it's hard to\\nimprove on the president's system yeah I I have no I\\nwouldn't I wouldn't pay a penny I'd pay to avoid it actually I mean uh and go\\nahead yeah the only point I'd like to add is the margins on writing auto insurance are four percent which is a\\nvery small number and once there are more people that are trying to take a bite of the Apple it just becomes very\\nvery difficult to keep all the mouths fed in a profitable manner\\nnow you can say the there was one big new idea in insurance and property and\\ncar insurance back in 1920 or so one State Farm started and State Farm\\nuh and still has it next to Berkshire it's it's our it's the leader in having net\\nworth it's a mutual company but some guy just figured that there was a cartel running\\ncar insurance and he Farmer for murder is the name of the\\nbook I think and over in Illinois and he created a system where he really took 20\\npoints or so out of the course and surprise surprise\\nareas you know and nobody's own stock in State Farm it's it's an insult to\\ncapitalism actually everything you learn at the business school says it shouldn't work because nobody\\nowns it nobody's going public with it no nothing but it's got more net worth it's almost probably double leaving Berkshire\\nout of the picture it's probably double the next guy and and nobody's really improved on their system that much so\\nit's fascinating how people don't really look at the essence\\nyou know these are cases that that should carry a message\\nuh but the truth is in Wall Street anything that gets the test is whether you can sell it or not but if if you can\\nsell it it'll get sold and a bunch of insurance companies came along and got a toll and this is this can be a story\\nabout this stock or that stock and it sounded good when they talked about it at Uber for a while it is it is really\\ninteresting the investing public does not learn much\\nokay station 11.\\nhi my name is Jeff Miriam I'm from Edina Minnesota we've been coming for years\\nto make that Professor from the earlier question really nervous half our family's wealth is in Berkshire Hathaway\\nwell let's make Charlie nervous my question has to do with voting\\ncontrol in the future there was a question earlier about corporate Raider I was more wondering about\\nwho is actually going to own the voting control uh is it going to be institutions uh Calpers BlackRock are\\nthey eventually going to get their way with the ESG\\ncheck boxes that we're gonna have to check and what should we be thinking about that well you're thinking very\\nwell and uh the interesting thing is uh the big\\naggregations look like of course they'd be in index funds but\\nwhat indirect funds want is they want a world in which Society\\ndoesn't get upset with them about the fact they've got all the voting power and and I would say in the last year or\\ntwo uh it's looked like a better idea uh for them not quite togethers uh uh uh\\nWhat was a praise the Charlie use it backed off a lot yeah they backed off\\na lot and and it's it's in their interest to back out off and interesting interestingly enough\\nand looking at money management you know the game\\nis not performance it's assets under management and index funds produce a\\ntiny tiny tiny uh fee on assets under management because it was pioneered by Vanguard and\\nuh and it's when it became successful it was very easy to replicate not so easy\\nbut I mean it was inevitable to be uh copied but it came with a management fee of two\\nbasis points so what people that have offered index funds would really like is\\nit to buy their other funds or level management money in some other way so that they get a higher\\nhigher fee on assets under management which of course is exactly why the index\\nfund was embedded in the first place but so it's gotten it's not a loss leader but it is a way\\nto pull money in and then you hope that people ignore what was said by by uh\\nwhat's the name that you know that John Bogle Jack Volvo uh ignore him and\\nessentially they give up the I say idea that will offer you a fund that does this in the India and we'll offer you\\nanother fund that does that and of course those management fees are higher so they're really counter selling the\\nidea that John Bogle came along with but in the process they have achieved a lot\\nof bolts and that was fun for a while but the last thing in the world I want\\nto do is that Washington or the American public decide that they're throwing\\naround their weight too much so they're tending to back off now if you figure out where their self-interest is you can\\njudge where their behavior is going to go oh yeah\\nyou're one of the Phantom no you can square me but he just said you're totally right on everything\\nwell in that case I won't ask anybody else okay Becky\\nall right this question comes from almu uh Grinnell and it's about\\nthis is for Warren and Greg since 2019 Berkshire repurchased huge amounts of stock about approximately reducing 10\\npercent of the share count and increasing the intrinsic value per share for the continuing shareholders Greg is\\nexpected to be the successor of Warren as CEO so will he be in charge of the main capital allocation decisions\\nincluding future share BuyBacks Greg has been key in the development of Berkshire Hathaway energy and I think a good\\nCapital allocator does he has he been involved in the share repurchases that have been executed over the past years\\nand do you both Warren and Greg work together in the estimation of berkshire's intrinsic value and the\\nshare buyback decisions well then the answer is that Greg I'm\\ngoing to turn it over to him but the answer is Greg understands Capital allocation as well as I do and that's\\nlucky for us and he will make those decisions I think very much in the same framework as I\\nwould make them and we've laid out that framework now for 30 years probably or something like that people make it way\\nmore complicated than I mean particularly if you're working on a doctorate or something it's just a great subject to have lots of footnotes and\\nyou know 50 pages or 100 pages but it's it's no more some it's no more\\ncomplicated than if you and I and Charlie had a business and you want to sell yours your interest in we could buy it\\nfor less than we thought it was worth and and without misleading you in any way about what was going on and we'd buy\\nit then but Greg you're on because you're going to be doing in the future right uh\\nyeah well I think Warren you said it really well I mean the framework's been laid out we know how you approach it and\\nwith uh and and how you and Charlie have approached it and and really don't see that framework changing when the\\nopportunity presents itself we'll want to be a an active repurchaser of Berkshire shares we think it's a it's a\\ngreat outcome for Berkshire shareholders so in a a larger piece of each of our operating businesses and our in the uh\\nportfolio of the equity companies when the when the opportunity presents itself it can be the dumbest thing you can do\\nor it can be the smartest thing you can do and you know to make it more complicated\\nthan that and start getting into all this but you obviously do what the business needs to do first the\\nopportunities are there grow your present business buy additional business whatever it may be and then then you\\nmake the decision on dividends but that decision becomes pretty irrevocable because you don't cut dividends and\\nwithout having a major effects in your shareholder base and a lot of things and\\nuh and then if you got ample capital and you don't see that you're going to use\\nit all and your stock is attractive and then it enhances the intrinsic value for the remaining\\nshareholders it's a no-brainer and if it's if it's above the price of intrinsic value it's a no-brainer that\\nyou don't even listen to anybody no matter what investment banker comes in and tells you here's how to do a repurchase program\\nokay station one\\nI'm Tom Nelson a podcast here from North Oaks Minnesota Charlie in 2022 you used phrases like\\nreally massively stupid massive kind of ignorance and crazy to describe what you\\nsaid was the 30 of Americans hesitant to submit themselves to untested mRNA covid\\ngene therapy do you stand behind those quotes today yeah sure\\nwell we got time for one more than before lunch Becky\\nokay [Laughter] but let's see uh\\n[Applause] how about oh uh\\ncould be how about lunch pretty soon but no no okay let's just got one for you this one comes from Drew Estes\\num this is a question for Warren in your 1969 letter to Partners you said in any\\ncompany where the founder and chief driving force behind the Enterprise is still active it's still very difficult\\nto evaluate second men the only real way to see how someone is going to do when when running a company is to let them\\nrun it this wise statement now applies to Berkshire once the second men are running Berkshire what would you advise\\nowners of Berkshire to watch for specifically what actions if taken should give us concern well I think I\\nwould just I would have some comfort in the fact that 99 of my net worth is in\\nthat company so I I probably got a stronger interest in it and and perhaps\\n100 billion or more of philanthropy will be affected by and uh\\nbut I would say that I don't have a second\\nchoice I mean that it it is it is that tough Divine but I've also seen\\nGreg in action that I feel 100 percent comfortable and uh uh uh\\nand like I say I don't know something happened to Greg I would tell the directors you know they have a problem\\nand they won't I don't have anybody to name and if they put somebody in\\nBergeron automatic pilot going to work extremely well\\nfor a long time I mean it doesn't it doesn't like the businesses go away or anything sort uh\\nand you can't it's hard to judge successor management\\nin a really good business because if they if they don't show up at the office it'll keep working for a long time and\\nmaybe maybe that like I've been useful input uh may show\\nitself in five years I mean it may go a long long long time and uh\\nhow how are the shareholders you know advised by a bunch of\\npeople that are concerned about whether you're meeting earnings projections or something telling them whether the\\nManagement's any good thing you know it is very very hard it's very hard I've\\nbeen on the board of 20 companies is very hard to do if you asked me to rank the management of each\\none it's uh it's it's very difficult to do because some are just better\\nbusinesses than others some would be better off not managed hardly at all others really need help but they got a\\nlousy business and uh Tom Murphy told me a long long time ago\\nis it the secret of business is to buy a good business and it's okay to inherit one too and Greg is inheriting a good\\nbusiness and I think he'll make it better but I don't think it's easy to put any one of the next 10 nominees\\nin and try and judge three years later whether they've done a good job or not so it's going to be a that'll be a very\\ninteresting job for the board but it shouldn't listen to Wall Street on it it they've got the job if they put\\nsomebody in there's a surprise we both got out on a plane that put somebody in they've got a real job in assessing that\\nperson as a it'll depend on how good he or she is as a talker it'll depend on\\nyou know them courting Wall Street to be supportive of all kinds of things and and uh uh we've got some very good\\npeople on the board but they would be challenged in that position as would I\\nwhere I've been in that position in other companies where a very great leader\\nhas left and uh on the way back from the funeral you know nobody knows what to do exactly\\nso with that Curie message we will go to lunch and we will come back\\n[Applause]\\nwe'll see at one o'clock thank you and and we're still going to try and get 60\\nQuestions in we've done 25 so far 20 yeah 25.\\nso keep the question short and I'll try and keep the answer short thanks\\ngood\\nwelcome back to our live coverage of the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting I'm Mike santoli the morning q a session\\nhas just ended Becky will rejoin me in a minute but let's recap some of the big\\nnews Warren Buffett Charlie Munger and Berkshire Vice chairs Greg Abel and Ajit Jain just made in the Q a session as\\nWarren mentioned they got through 25 questions a lot of them pretty wide-ranging at the top but if it did\\nsay that the way things are tracking right now most of berkshire's operating businesses look like they'll be down in\\nearnings for 2023 so the broader economic slowdown is reaching them broad exposure to railroads and Building\\nProducts as well as energy and a lot of consumer areas so that's probably not a surprise but it is a contrast to the\\nrise in operating earnings they had in the first quarter now on Apple in response to a shareholder question that\\nApple was becoming a very large percentage of the Investment Portfolio some 35 percent according to the\\nquestion actually it's approaching half of the equity Securities in the portfolio and Warren Buffett said that's\\nnot the way they think about it they think about their entire business as being the portfolio so apple is not a\\nparticularly large sale if you consider the companies the businesses that they own outright and therefore he also said\\napple is a much better business than any one of their operating businesses they wish probably they could own all of it\\nbut right for now they own almost six percent Apple keeps buying back a ton of stock which raises uh berkshire's\\nproportion of the whole company which they're pretty happy with at the moment Buffett also said in response to a\\nquestion about how he quickly sold out of Taiwan semiconductor after having built the stake not long before uh\\nBuffett said he feels just his capital is safer in Japan than in Taiwan they're\\na little concerned obviously about geopolitical tensions in Japan in Taiwan excuse me uh really does like the\\ninvestments in the Japanese trading houses financed with very inexpensive borrowing rings are in Yan so that was\\nessentially some of the headlines out there a lot of skeptical comments about AI in response to some questions as to\\nwe're going to get to a lot of those details meanwhile cnbc.com's banking reporter Houston at CNBC headquarters\\nright now and Hugh you know Warren and Charlie didn't spend a whole lot of time this morning talking about the banks so\\ndespite all the recent Regional banking turmoil they didn't really get many pointed questions on it but did get one\\nI wonder what you make of that yeah so the one question they did get was the very first of the day which was you know\\nwhat would have happened to uh you know to the US if svb's uninsured depositors were allowed to go under and Warren was\\nvery clear on that he said that it would have led to a disaster that essentially uh it would have led to a run on every\\nBank in the in the country the following morning so essentially an important thing to do I think you know for my\\nmoney it is more interesting about what he hasn't said than what he has which is you know we're at a moment in this country where you know the business\\nmodel Regional banking is under attack and we're wondering whether or not the market is essentially pushing otherwise\\nhealthy Banks to the brink and so you know the question of the hour for me and hopefully gets this in the second half\\nof the afternoon in the Q a um you know is whether or not that there's a point a price in which he's\\nwilling to deploy capital and clearly you know for those who don't know the backdrop is the Warren Buffett has been\\ntime and time again one of the most important uh you know backstops of of the U.S banking industry in this country\\nthat he has provided Capital he has provided confidence the U.S banking uh\\nto the U.S banking industry time and time again and and so we're all dying really just to figure out what he's going to say and you know if he doesn't\\nsay anything about this I would I would point to the idea that perhaps uh it is\\na bit early to get involved in Banks I mean he's given uh pretty negative comments to our Becky quick but only\\nlast month about you know his prospects for Banking and that's certainly one of the things I want to hear\\nyeah for sure and and I guess you might also be able to argue that the particular banks that are most Under\\nPressure right now are relatively small they're literally you know Regional they're restricted to small parts of the\\ncountry they're not necessarily big long-term franchises that would meet the other uh investment criteria perhaps\\nthat he might look for uh but it's interesting that he did not really change his uh Holdings in this latest\\nquarter in Bank of America in Citigroup presumably uh so that would suggest that there's not a general concern about the\\noverall system but maybe also at least as far as we know did not find fresh reason to uh to extend Capital to some\\nof the struggling Banks yeah I mean you know he he spent the last three years um cutting his stakes and Banks he you\\nknow at one point in 2019 2018 uh he loaded up on JP Morgan Goldman Sachs uh\\nand had a significant stake in Wells Fargo Wells Fargo historically had been one of their biggest Holdings and he'd paired back after their fake account\\nScandal so and you know more recently he's paired back in PNC and used Bancorp so certainly I think you know the\\ngeneral sort of idea is that he's loath to own Banks heading into a potential economic downturn and certainly that's\\nstill the case where we are to this day Mike for sure a related area of course uh\\nthis morning one of the shareholders asked about problems in commercial real estate uh now Charlie Munger has been\\noutspoken about the banks being full of what he said were bad loans while he said this morning this would not be a\\nBerkshire problem he is concerned about the situation listen to what he said I do think that the hollowing out of the\\ndowntowns in the United States and elsewhere in the world is going to be quite significant and quite unpleasant I think\\nthe country will get through it all right but as they say it will awfully it will\\noften involve a different set of owners\\nyeah Mikey news of you that that is one of the the sort of feared after effects\\nor exacerbating factors with the regional banking crisis of course is their own exposure to commercial real estate yeah 100 I mean that would\\ncertainly feed into this thesis that maybe now is not the time to to come into the banks even considering how\\nshellac those stocks have been in in since the svb collapsed back in March um clearly uh you know the concern right\\nnow is that these banks are holding tons of loans uh either to you know office Builders commercial real estate loans\\nthat type of thing which are set for some pain in the coming months and that has yet to actually play out it's\\ncertainly something that we're all keeping our eyes on sure uh also seem some skepticism about\\nthe asset class of commercial real estate in general Lauren saying that people just essentially pay for a\\nbuilding whatever they can borrow so it's not a lot of price discipline there perhaps or valuation Focus uh Q thanks\\nBecky is now back with us and uh Becky we hit on a couple of the points uh well we I mentioned what he had to say about\\nApple uh essentially he's not worried about it getting to be at too big a position because he views it\\nholistically with within the entirety of Berkshire not just talked about it I can't remember if we were on camera when\\nwe were going together or but talking about what a big position it is you know if you don't think about it\\nfrom his perspective I hadn't just in terms of okay you're not talking about a stock portfolio you are talking about an\\noverall portfolio of a company and the amount that that goes into it what kind of stunned me is the idea that he said\\napple is a Better Business than any of the businesses that we own in whole exactly without it we did mention that\\nthat's a big headline and you know and he said look we have great businesses we have a great Railroad and all the rest of it but I think just that's what the\\nnumbers would tell you yeah and just in terms of the the profitability the sustainability of profit margins the\\nLoyalty of the customer so it was interesting he also you know he's got a lot of things working in his favor which\\nis as he said Apple continues to buy back shares from everybody else but him yeah and raising his ownership stake in\\nthe business you know it occurred to me at the time I maybe we'll get a chance to ask him this at some point but if that's the case why don't you just put\\nmore money in apple yeah you've got 130 billion dollars on those sitting around in cash obviously he always wants to\\nhave a lot of cash he's talked about 50 billion or more in the past that he'll have on hand but that still leaves you a\\nlot of wiggle room and that makes you think that he must be keeping some of that other dry powder to be opportunistic videos that come along it\\nfeels like there's a general poll where that in dollar terms that position keeps getting bigger because Apple does well\\nagain they buy back stock from everybody else I will say it's a much more expensive stock now than it was when he\\nbought it eight years ago seven years maybe that's the explanation I mean back then he felt like it was undervalued because people didn't recognize in his\\nview that it was a kind of a indispensable consumer product in the minds of their customers whereas now\\nit's kind of valued the way those other consumers pay for businesses are all right let's listen to what Warren actually had to say we've got those\\ncomments about Apple Apple you know has a position with consumers\\nwhere they're paying you know maybe the paid 1500 bucks or whatever it\\nmay be for a phone and these same people pay 35 000 for having a second car and if they\\nhad to give up a second car or give up their iPhone they'd give up their second car I mean it's an extraordinary\\nprobably we don't have anything like that that we own 100 of but we're very\\nvery very happy to have 5.6 or whatever it may be percent and we're delighted\\nevery tenth of a percent that goes up it's like adding a hundred million dollars to our earnings I mean our share\\nof the earnings and they use the earnings to buy out our partners which we're glad to see them sell out too\\nall right now what right now we want to bring in renowned corporate lawyer and Berkshire director Ron Olson Ron is also\\none of the top shareholders of berkshire's shares as well we keep an eye on a lot of these things\\num Ron thank you for joining us this morning hi uh we just want to talk to you about\\nwhat you heard in the first part of this meeting because I I think they were pretty reflective pretty\\num focused on a lot of the succession issues and what's going to happen what's taking place with both Greg Abel and\\nAjit Jain being in the positions they're in maybe stepping up and doing a lot more of the day-to-day work and activities over the last few years as a\\nboard member the board's been kind of understanding of what's been driving those things what do you all talk about\\nin the board meeting what do you think of what you heard today well you're right Becky there's a lot of\\nfocus on succession but what I took away from the meeting part of which was not\\navailable to the general public was what was going on in the movie that preceded it there was a focus on succession for\\nover the last three decades year after year and look what we have on this stage what\\nI heard coming from what a combined 101 years\\nfrom Warren and Charlie was an amazing reflection of their energy and their\\nwisdom 101 years of business Berkshire right right and to me\\nthey've got a long run way ahead and we are so fortunate to have Greg\\nAbel designated as Warren's successor and the board feels enormous confidence\\nand I can detail a little of that if you want but that's\\nuh we've had a lot of contact with Greg\\npersonally I've known him since we bought Mid-America quite a number of years ago\\ntiny little company had a asset over in the Philippines that generated some\\nenergy from geothermal a couple other little things and look what that company is today Greg has\\nbuilt that Warren not Charlie Greg has built that good bit of it was by acquisition\\nand people worry about Greg's ability to make Acquisitions I don't the war\\ndoesn't he's a numbers guy just like Warren's a numbers guy I'm not they are and he has\\nyou know the fundamentals high integrity high intelligence uh recently this last year I got more\\nthan what I've had before about Greg by having him as a client\\nI work very closely with him on one matter this is a person\\nwho leaves nothing for doubt he plans he's skillful he has a political skill\\nthat I would say exceeds Warren and Charlie's so we're very excited Warren\\nalso said that he is a great Capital allocator which is pretty much uh High Praise as you said he's done plenty of M\\nA so if you were worried about that part of the business but it's interesting because there's always this line that\\nhas to be walked which is look this company's going to be great as structured almost no matter who's running it and on top of it we have\\ngreat people who are going to be running because Warren just said before the break there you know Berkshire on autopilot would work extremely well for\\nsome period of time yeah I think Charlie said it slightly differently he said\\nit's we've given this a lack of attention and I suggest that that's what\\nthe rest of you should do after we leave we've got phenomenal managers and so\\nthere's a high level of confidence in the future and I don't I I if people\\ndidn't take that away from this morning Becky I'll be surprised well it's also I was going to just mention too that a\\ncouple of questions uh about you know once the uh the shares are you know\\nthey've been donated once they convert to class B shares the voting control slowly over time eventually will make\\nits way out into the public and this seeming concern about what that would mean in terms of activists or somebody\\nuh you know altering the strategy or makeup of the of the company and I any warns him to say nobody could afford to\\nreally muscle this company around at this point especially in 10 or 15 years well I I happen to agree I've done a\\nfair amount of work for companies who have been subjected to what we call activists investors Through The Years\\nincluding some of the names mentioned today um\\nI don't see that being a serious threat in any way shape or form\\nit is a huge company as Warren pointed out largest net worth in the\\nyou know s p 500. uh uh so\\nand I think another point to be made in that respect is it's not just one\\nand Charlie's Holdings of the stock we've got shareholders who are devoted\\nto this stock and so long as we behave they will trust their savings with us\\nand that's what I want to ask you about Ron just the the number of items on on\\nthe ballot this time around on the proxy for ESG for other things they want to\\npush the company to do push the board to do changes whether that be looking at\\nclimate change whether that be saying I'm not going to ever have anyone at the company have a political perspective that's made public I mean those are\\nthings that that Warren and Charlie both have been pretty disdainful of the idea that anybody else gets to force all the\\nrest of the shareholders and the rest of the company what to do and that's fine because Warren and Charlie are in a\\nposition to be able to say those things I think the key is probably the shareholder base are you convinced that\\nthe shareholder base will remain the same and second of all will they vote\\nwill they actually go out and vote because retail investors in general don't vote on these things they just let it ride which is why you can have\\nsomebody get a small portion of the vote and and have their away with things well the increasing\\npercentage of ownership by some of the large index funds and so\\non yes that's a different kind of investment but I don't see that\\novertaking the individual shareholders that have been our base for years their confidence\\nI think will remain as long as we have the kind of leadership we've had and\\nGreg's not going to change that these managers are not going to disappear if\\nwe make other Acquisitions I've Got Confidence we will and I've Got Confidence that they will be made\\nsoundly with leadership that Warren has said for years the kind of\\nleadership that love their money or love their business more than they love their\\nmoney and they'll be devoted to what is in the best interest of these individual\\nshareholders so you take the these four initiatives climate change is\\na big issue no question about it and by the way I thought Warren's comment today about\\none more thing we as a country should be thinking about is how we're going to\\nmobilize the the dedication to climate change as\\nwe did mobilize the country in defending World War II or pursuing World War II\\num and there's a lot that can be done but I don't think very many companies\\nhave done more than Berkshire and I don't think the people that are pushing these initiatives really understand what\\nthe monies we are devoting to for instance transmission building which is\\nessential to get renewable energy where it needs to be you know what Greg has done out in Iowa\\nbuilding capacity for nearly 100 percent of the ratepayers\\nit's great Ron one last question before you go is there something you're hoping to hear more about in the second round\\nis there something you're hoping to hear in the second round of q a you mean this afternoon yeah\\num I don't I don't have any great I don't think there's a need for\\nme filling in the blanks for what they're going to say but uh there is a\\nseriousness of purpose about this meeting that simply has not reflected in\\nany other meeting annual meeting I go to and I go to a number and that comes\\nabout I think because of the mutual respect between the audience that is the\\nshareholders and the management and I want to see that continue and I'm sure\\nit will this afternoon Olson who is a Berkshire board member want to thank you so much for your time today Ron I'm delighted to be here it's\\ngreat to see you thank you thank you thanks Ron it is AI of course is all the rage right\\nnow with recent earnings calls flooded with references one of the shareholders wanted to get Warren and Charlie's\\nthoughts not surprisingly Charlie Munger did not hold back I am personally\\nskeptical of some of the hype that is going into artificial intelligence\\nI think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well Jay can do all kinds of things and\\nwhen something can do all kinds of things I get a little bit worried uh and uh\\nbecause I know we won't be able to uninvent it and uh you know we did invent\\nuh for very very good reason the atom bomb in in World War II and it\\nwas you know it was enormously important that we did so\\nbut is it good for the next 200 years of the world that that the ability to do so has\\nbeen Unleashed we didn't have a choice but uh uh\\nwhen you start something well Einstein said after after the Adam Bomb he said this has changed everything in the world\\nexcept how men think and uh I would say the same thing may not not\\nthe same thing I don't mean that but I mean they with with AI uh it can change everything in the world\\naccept it how men think and behave\\njoining us now is noted Tech investor Ann winblad she's co-founder and managing partner of Hummer win by\\nVenture Partners uh and and it's great to see you thanks so much thanks for having me for stopping by here\\num so there's a fair bit I guess you would say of skepticism about uh ai's\\nability to completely upend all these industries and maybe act as a threat to a lot of the businesses that Berkshire\\nowns but also also suspicion about uh as Warren says you can't uninvent it and there are some unintended consequences\\nas a tech investor looking for disruptive ideas how are you framing uh this opportunity well we're affirming\\nthis opportunity is significant the challenge for many companies we heard in\\nthe description of Geico today where when asked about telematics which is basically analytics the step before\\ngenerative AI as we're discussing today and even there it Ajit mentioned that\\nthey have to still finish their digital transformation process with their poor\\nComputing architecture before they get to core analytics let alone get to generative AI so we'll see this go very\\nvery fast in the tech industry itself but it'll take a little bit more time to\\nreach core industries that we're talking about today and one of the things that really struck\\nme and you've come to this meeting every year so you hear these things um Lauren kind of laid out the case when\\nwhen we asked about companies that are offering Insurance whether that be Tesla or some of the other auto companies also offering\\ninsurance he pointed out that there have been probably 10 insurance companies that have launched and called themselves\\ntechnology companies we're technology company we're a technology company we're a technology company most of them have failed because they stink at actual\\nunderwriting they're no good at taking risks and figuring out how to price it which is what insurance is he said everybody's a technology company you can\\nlook at any of these companies they all use technology as a tech investor how do you figure out who's a tech company and\\nit was just a company that uses technology how do you differentiate it well we focus on Enterprise infrastructure so when we look at the\\nbig pieces starting to move around like adding new infrastructure like generative AI it means that you've got\\nto change the mechanisms that connect all the wheels in generative AI one of the big issues is going to be how you\\nget all this data to keep feeding the machine and making it more intelligent that's with apis and we built company\\ncalled mulesoft that's part of CRM now that deals with apis about 10 years ago\\nnow they were not a CRM company they were an API company so we're under the\\nhood and under the hood is what they call Deep Tech which everybody says they're investing in these days so we\\ntry to look at the engineering of this versus the verticalization because we\\ncan't be experts in these industries and this is where technology investors do go astray we know technology we don't know\\ninsurance we don't know retail we don't know education unless you're a specialty investor there okay then let me ask you\\none more question on that point Apple everybody thinks it's a technology company Warren Buffett started investing because he said it's not it's a consumer\\nProducts company is Apple a tech company and do you think it still has advantages of a tech company is that why you would\\nbuy the stock Apple is a consumer company it is in the US it has for a\\nwhile it was a luxury brand now it's a global brand it is an enormously\\nsuccessful brand company but it has to make technology work to do that and it\\nalso sells us that technology in a consumer Appliance\\nthat's it's done for 16 years it's amazing that the iPhone is 16 years old\\nso I think if you walk around and ask people to describe the technology they're walking around with they can't\\ndescribe the components of the iPhone but they can describe their experience with that piece of technology and that\\nmakes it a consumer company you mentioned this is all going very fast that you mentioned generative AI a\\ncouple of times is it a qualitatively different thing or is it just what we've\\ngenerally become accustomed to which is waves of you know Innovation wash\\nthrough software gets better get smarter you know Big Data was a buzz phrase a\\ncouple of years ago how different is what we used to talk about as big data from AI all right it does come in which\\nand there are failure waves to come first and we've been working on AI way for a long long time as long as I've\\nbeen in technology which has been over four decades but what we now have is hyperscale Computing we have companies\\nthat are now part of this like Nvidia which really provides that infrastructure that we can do this so\\nwe're really moving to hyperscale Computing which allows us to process this data really fast if you've used\\nchat GPT one of the magical things about it is there's no latency it's just\\ninstant we're going to couple this in the next wave called Quantum Computing\\nwhich of course the big tech companies are working at but realistically it's allowing us to harness data in a very\\nvery different way and also use what we call machine learning in in a much more\\ndeeper way so when we combine all these hyperscale computings with massive\\namounts of data with the the Improvement in artificial intelligence out it is a\\nsignificant way all those other pieces came along as little ways but this is the big one Quantum will be big once it\\nfinally happens as well which is the next phase of hyperscale computing and great to catch up with you thanks so\\nmuch thank you for the rest of the meeting okay a number of companies that are here in the showroom are marking sales\\nMilestones this weekend because there's a lot of people noticed that already one of those\\ncompanies is See's Candies it's a record first hour of sales when it opened for business yesterday at noon and that's\\npretty amazing because if you look at the sales that they're doing through here uh we got the chance to catch up with\\nthe CEO Pat Egan and the Seas Booth here that is a front and center location and\\nit is worth it we are so proud of this place we actually have more square footage and\\nwe're there's a little bit jealousy going on here because we have so much square footage but it's because we got\\nto sell all the scripts yeah I was going to say look at some of the crowds over here this is why you have all the square footage well last year was fast and hot you can ask me questions about this we\\nhave started even faster okay so last year Mr Buffett made a big deal about it in the annual letter this year he said\\nthat you guys sold 11 tons of candy just on the two days of the shareholder meeting last year four hundred thousand\\ndollars does that wreck up to about yeah in a little bit yes how long does it take your average store to get four\\nhundred thousand dollars would be a good several months okay so you do that in two days several months okay so that's a\\ngood return 1972 is when this purchase was made um Warren Buffett has talked about how\\n25 million dollars they bought the company for he was haggling didn't want to pay 30 million dollars he got a great deal he says he's got more than two\\nbillion dollars in pre-tax income that's come from your company in the days since adding to that yes so what have you done\\nfor him lately well um so year over year we feel really fortunate getting through 2020 which was\\nnot our best year ever 2021 our Centennial year we turned 100 our best year ever by a mile and then we we built\\non that last year this year we started even better obviously our costs like everybody else are going up you asked me\\nlast year about our commodity costs and I gave you a different answer than I would give you this year but uh but we're definitely making our contribution\\nso what uh what is happening with commodity prices this year it's gone up significantly so and they're actually they're just finally starting to level\\noff but over the last nine months or so actually when you asked me that question last year it was we had actually bought\\nso much on the forward Market that we felt really good pasta butter as an example is up over 100 for us cost of\\nsugar up over 100 for us so it's definitely taking a little bit of a bite but we have enough volume and we have\\nenough history that we have been able to manage through that very well what about other inflationary pressures you get hit\\nwith higher wages higher energy costs you know our customers and our employees are living life just different like\\neverybody else and and running into the same challenges and so we definitely want to make sure take care of our\\nemployees so our benefits costs and and everything else that goes with that have definitely gone up as well but uh but\\nwe've been able to manage through it pretty well sales in 2020 were down because stores were closed people can go into them\\num what happened was great but we yeah we closed we closed very early on because we made the decision that uh we\\ndon't know what we're dealing with if you go back to March 16th of 2020. if you don't know what you're dealing with that moment in time or for customers and\\nour employees who chose to close our retail operations we reopened after about a month and a half we opened phone\\nservice and buy online pickup in store and then all of our shops were reopened by the Fall yeah and you actually had some really strong like people were\\nwilling to spend on things yeah if they were buying it online or doing other things going along those lines they were paying premium for things yeah is that\\nstill the case with consumers if you see any weakness uh no I think we still we still maintained really a high level so\\nour package count for example on e-commerce has gone up about double in the last in the last couple of years and\\nit's maintained we haven't actually we hit a peak and then we've maintained it we haven't dropped off is that at the expense of sales in stores or that's\\ngone up too both are growing e-commerce has been growing faster but our shop sales have also been I've also been good\\nBobby kodek is here as well he's the CEO of Activision Blizzard and he's a long time visitor to Omaha for the Berkshire\\nmeeting he's been coming lots and lots and lots of years when's the first time you were here Bobby\\nuh early 1990s and why did you come in the beginning well I was very fortunate I had the\\nchance to meet Warren in the 1980s because my college roommate had their\\nfamily sold partial cohens to Berkshire and um I knew the goddess men's and had a\\nchance to meet him and it's one of the great privileges of my life is that relationship that I have with Charlie\\nand with Warren and last year you were here at the annual meeting and you had to leave a little early I\\nthink there was a birthday party you were getting back for is this what happened I I left around this time yeah\\nand then uh uh our friend Patty sellers phoned me and said are you still here and I said\\nno I'm on my way to the airport and she said oh uh Warren just announced he owns I think nine percent of your company\\nwhich was a big surprise to me and um but you know one of the great votes of confidence that you could ever get yeah\\nhow'd you feel about that after knowing them for so long you know like I said I don't think there's anything when I\\nthink about my business career that announcement was one of the\\nPinnacles of my business experience to know that that Warren and Charlie had so much faith and confidence in the company\\nyeah one of the things he said at time was partially it was because he was\\ndoing a little bit of Arbitrage there was a deal from Microsoft the stock was trading under the deal price and you\\nsaid look just looking at it and like that they did announce in the last quarterly result that they had sold some\\nof the stock I don't know if you've had any conversations with him what you think about it or what else is going on up\\nthere I I've never had one conversation with them about it I um you know I just I'm\\ngrateful if if they own 10 shares or they own nine percent a lot more than 10\\nshares that they own I think that their last it was 6.7 stake that they wanted yeah\\nI think they may be your biggest shareholder yeah I think they probably are too um we talked with you a week ago after\\nthe UK regulator basically said they didn't agree with the deal with Microsoft do you have any updates I know\\nthat you and Microsoft are both appealing this you guys are gonna fight this out any update on what you can't tell us on\\nthat front well we've had a chance to read what uh the CMA had to say and you\\nknow the number of different uh bases for appeal there's a technical basis that is\\nirrationality and this one is in the clearly irrational but um you know we'll appeal\\nand I think uh it's very nonsensical decision and uh and we'll see what\\nhappens the appeal process is kind of convoluted it's it's not like other places and that's why there's been so much writing on this because in this\\ncase the CMA is who you appeal to to basically say hey this is illogical this is irrational can you give me another\\ndecision is that how it works or is there a different way to go through it I don't know all the technicalities but\\nthere are process issues they're procedural issues there's the purely irrational\\num but I think then yes it would go back to the CMA and then presumably they\\nwould probably accept the remedies that it seemed like they had already accepted\\nin a situation like this you obviously have to run the business as it is right\\nnow as you still hope to anticipate that you'll be part of a bigger company um\\nyou know how do you sort of walk that line to a degree I mean what are the prospects of the business right now as\\nan independent company are they different from if you're inside of Microsoft well we had in the first quarter record performance all of our\\nfranchises are doing incredibly well the business is uh moving along at a really\\nfabulous Pace our people are really excited they're really motivated they see all the prospects and opportunities\\nand I think it's one of the nice things about this transaction we're hopeful that we can complete it but if it\\ndoesn't get completed you know by the end of the year we'll be sitting on probably only 17 or 18 billion dollars\\nof cash including the three billion dollar breakup fee including the breakup fee if that were to happen and I think\\nyou know we're in the enviable position of when I was thinking about being here and what we have so you know like Call\\nof Duty is Coca-Cola and Candy Crush is American Express and we were toying with\\nwhat Geico is and I think it's probably the closest to work crap but\\num so you know all you need are three things like that that have the ability to generate High Returns on invested\\nCapital over long periods of time and is it safe to say you are thinking about what you would do on either pathway at\\nthis point making sure that you've got a plan no matter what happens well remember we've we've been owned before\\nso we had a control shareholder and we're operating the business today fully\\nindependently making all the thoughtful decisions the only thing that we can't really do would be to allocate the big\\nwe're sitting on roughly 13 billion of cash today so that's the only thing that\\nwe really can't do but other than that running the business the way we ordinarily would you saying you can't you know find new strategic uses for\\nthat cash while the deal is pent we can't but we're also earning five percent on our cash balances so that's\\nchanged we didn't get the 5.9 I I wish we had gotten to that but it was a\\nmoment in time yeah but we're still in the five which\\nis just thinking eight 18 months ago we were in the zero right so\\num even if you get past the CMA in the UK the FTC has been pretty tough on this too and Lena Khan has made some pretty\\ntough statements even in the last week or so continues to say that there needs to be more regulation of companies and\\nthat they're going to be taking a very hard line at this and I just wonder what you think that means broadly for mergers\\nand Acquisitions and for competition in the United States you know I I I I don't think it's great\\nfor America to have the government preventing you from what our sensible business\\ncombinations when I look at Grail as a great example this is an extraordinary\\ncompany with incredible technology that actually can help prevent cancer the\\nyes and so I think what we want to try and avoid our government doing is preventing\\nthings that are going to create opportunity for Innovation and growth and especially for American companies\\nand American workers who now have to compete on a global scale in a way that we never have before and so I just hope\\nthat I think some rational thinking will start to come into government when it comes to protecting American consumers\\nAmerican workers and American businesses Bobby I want to thank you for being with\\nus today it's always a pleasure and we really appreciate your time today thank you guys for having me I really\\nappreciate it we'll see you back in there because you're not looking I know I'm here for the duration okay Bobby Kodak right now we want to\\nget over to our Squawk Box supervising producer Katie Kramer she is live on the showroom floor right now she's been\\nchecking things out over at the Oriental Trading booth and Katie what are you learning it's good to see you\\ngood to see you guys too you really get the festival feeling of Woodstock for capitalists when you're on the showroom\\nfloor 20 000 square feet of shopping experiences activations dozens of\\nBerkshire portfolio companies have experiences here for shareholders at Oriental Trading they are celebrating retro this year we have some rubber\\nduckies of Warren in 1973 with a duck Street Journal we have a Charlie rubber\\nduck who's wearing a leisure suit that's also perfect for celebrating the Retro look and\\na special a couple special guests actually flow the flamingo from Oriental Trading and probably the youngest\\nshareholder here how are you guys where are you from We're from Kansas and is this your first\\ntime at the annual meeting second time who's

your company Clayton Homes makes attainable housing mobile modular or manufactured housing for a\\nmiddle class consumer we tagged along for a tour of the model home Clayton is showing here at the Berkshire annual\\nmeeting the company announced its move to build all new residential manufactured homes to do uh Department\\nof Energy Zero Energy ready home specifications by 2024. CEO Kevin\\nClayton showed Warren Buffett around this home travels in one section down\\nthe road so that's right it's amazing that's one thing that helps with the affordability so less Transportation\\ncosts less setup costs and then we'll build the Breezeway in the garage on their site\\nso the gses now are saying maybe we should allow a single section as well under the cross mod program which makes\\na lot of sense did the truck stop and pilot then and that's right okay yeah okay you'll see so many Berkshire\\nproducts used throughout this home from all the flooring insulation the my tech gang Nails yeah\\nWarren does it make us louder we do it because they're the best\\ncost and quality Bill what's best for Clayton than the customer\\nalso with mortgage rates more than doubled since what we've seen happening earlier in the year go ahead you can\\nroll anytime if you'd like since the fed's first of 10 consecutive rate hikes in the last 14 months finding affordable\\nhousing is obviously difficult for a lot of prospective buyers looking at the Clayton house with a price point of\\nunder two hundred thousand dollars of course that doesn't include the land but that's for them to come out set the house up put it all get it ready to go\\nthat's what caused Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger to actually reflect on their own homes\\nCharlie lives in the house that he was\\nbuilding in 1950. nine when I met him and I had just moved into my house in\\n1958 and we're both in the same houses I I don't know how many people that\\nhave changed their situations actually I had a friend who built of marble Palace\\nin Beverly Hills a Marvel stream that ran through the foyer and I went to dinner there and I said you know I don't\\nneed it no I thought he fell into it\\nCharlie build a little house for me in the back [Music] but he's\\nI I've got one house still and how many houses do you have absolutely five seven\\nseven yeah he's real estate poor\\nyeah Charlie says he's got seven houses but he said that's the ones my kids and my grandkids live in you know I think\\nit's his house and then the place that he used to always go in Minnesota way up in the summertime those were the two\\nplaces he goes and he still goes there he's been going there every year since he was a kid I mean over the course of a\\nhundred years it's not that many houses to acquire it's a reasonable Pace maybe if you're\\nlucky uh well with us now is Berkshire director Howard G Buffett also chairman and CEO of the Howard G Buffett\\nFoundation focusing on food security and conflict mitigation his new book courage\\nof a Nation deals with his experiences in Ukraine he's traveled to Ukraine seven times since the Russian invasion\\nand his foundation has donated 150 million dollars to humanitarian efforts there with plans to double that this\\nyear Howard thank you for joining us yeah it was great to be here wow I mean let's just start right there in terms of\\nyour your assessment of your work there and uh and just the state of things yeah\\nI mean it's it's a really tough place right now and and I think the hardest thing to watch when you're there is the\\nuh it's a war in civilians and and Russia has been uh very brutal about how\\nthey've implemented this Invasion and so you have a lot of people that are suffering uh people go to bed it doesn't\\nmatter where you are in Ukraine you go to bed you don't know you know if a missile is going to hit you that night that's a pretty tough situation to live\\nin Howard how many times have you been there well is there once in 1991 what\\nwas the Soviet Union which is interesting to compare it to today and then I've been there seven times I have three more trips planned this year\\nwould you get involved with it how did you meet up because you've met with the president zielinsky uh several times yeah well when Russia invaded it became\\nclear to me right away it was going to have a huge impact globally on food security so we started looking at where would we fit in and of course the most\\nimmediate things we've done have been in Ukraine but we have also\n",
