            "we are here live in Omaha Nebraska good morning everybody I'm Becky quick\\nalong with Mike santoli and in just 30 minutes time Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO Warren Buffett's going to be\\ntaking the stage with his vice chair Charlie Munger the legendary duo will also be joined by berkshire's two other\\nVice chairs Greg Abel who manages the non-insurance operations for the company and Ajit Jain who runs all of the\\ninsurance businesses and as always it's pretty big crowd here lots and lots of people and a few people you might notice\\ntoo Tim Cook is here Apple of course is still berkshire's largest holding big big part of its portfolio there you see\\nhim backstage getting ready to go out and take his seat he gets to sit down in the special seats by the way that's\\nDebbie pasonic Warren's assistant who's standing by just went bite beside him also in the crowd Bill Murray he has\\nbeen here for a couple of days been hanging around you can check out he is taking a seat right now too some other\\nbig people who are expected to be here some well-known names Jane Frazier who's the city CEO Ruth parat of alphabet\\nshe's actually here I did and see her a little earlier and by the way this was a scene just a short time ago as the\\nBerkshire shareholders who were first in line started streaming onto the floor Mike this is like um Black Friday used\\nto be yeah day after Thanksgiving people waiting lining up these were the doors\\num yeah it was a big rush they opened and everybody comes running in and it's not just because of the rain outside absolutely if it's a massive Arena\\nConvention Center so people know and uh I don't know what time do they start lining up I looked out the window at 5\\n30 and I thought huh that's not as big of a crowd as I've seen in years past but then I realized it's because they\\nchanged the setup for this people used to stand about 10 Deep right at the door this year they pushed everybody the\\ncrowds down the the block because they I guess they didn't want too much of a mob scene in one place if you watched it\\nwent for blocks I didn't realize it till I went to the other side of the hotel to see it went for blocks and blocks and I've honestly never seen a line this\\nlong a lot of people around the convention center talking about how it's it's buzzier and more crowded in the\\nexhibit all this year versus last year which was the first after the pandemic of course they broke for two years so it\\nseems like there is a little more of a interest in uh in being here in person well they know how to time it there's a lot of news that's happening um usually\\nyou get about 40 000 people who are here this year they've been running ahead just in terms of the number of tickets\\nthat they gave out and I talked to Warren Buffett briefly last night he said that they had 6 000 people who\\nshowed up at will call yesterday to try and get last minute tickets they ran out of tickets they had to go print more to\\ntry and get people in the doors and they've never seen anything like that and as you mentioned the stuff sold out\\nif you if you look at some of the places that are back here we're going to talk about some of these companies but he's been running the numbers and seeing what\\nhappened I I won't say too much now but he's been tabulating all of this up to see exactly what their sales are running\\nlike here versus uh years fast obviously this is sort of a weird microcosm of the\\nof the business in the company as a whole and it's uh it's it's not Revenue neutral as he always talks about it\\nlooks you're paying you're paying to play here you are in fact it is going to be a big day here first though we should\\ntalk about the news at hand Berkshire is out with first quarter earnings and that came just moments ago Mike has been\\ndigging through all the numbers on this and there's some stories to be told here there are first of all a big swing to the upside in the overall reported\\nearnings number uh from about five and a half billion uh dollars in the first quarter last year to 35 and a half\\nbillion but almost all that swing was the The Mark to Market on the Investment Portfolio operating earnings though is\\nstill a good story up almost 13 percent you know over a year up to about a little more than eight billion dollars\\num it seems like the insurance business specifically Geico swinging to a fatter\\nunderwriting profit from last year we could talk about exactly how they got there but it seems as if higher pricing\\nless advertising Revenue they they went from margin as opposed to Pure market share it seems at this point also on the\\ninvestment side uh seems like there was a reduction in the Chevron stake uh over\\nthe course of the quarter you have to back into the numbers based on the dollar value of the stakes that they give you in the share prices at the time\\nbut essentially it seems like he Berkshire was a seller of about 20 percent of that stake it's like oh\\nthat's a big six or seven billion uh dollars worth okay and um so it's still a significant holding I think it's also\\nkeep worth keeping in mind Chevron stock was up over 50 last year so simply by the market appreciating the the dollar\\nvalue went up fair bit well it's interesting though if they were selling some of that steak while they were building the oxy stake uh the accident\\npetroleum stake um not a call necessarily on oil overall just maybe\\npicking exactly relative value or or positioning uh within that uh also\\nBerkshire a net seller of overall Equity uh Securities in the quarter but the\\nmajority of that net reduction seems to be the Chevron I think the rest of it's hard to know Apple pretty much unchanged\\nof course the Stock's up a lot but the position is unchanged uh Bank of America also seems unchanged too so those are\\ntwo not a lot of change in terms of the key core holder for Bank of America that's the one bank that he has kept he\\nsold out of a handful of other Banks Banks some of them that he's held for a very long time so Bank of America still\\nseems to be his favorite maybe we'll hear more about that today you would hope yeah and just maybe General thoughts about his assessment of the\\nbanking system and uh whether it needs help whether it looks like it's an opportunity you have all these\\nvaluations that have been crushed another thing to keep in mind uh for the quarter there was four and a half\\nbillion dollars of shares bought back by Berkshire so that was up from 3.2\\nbillion in the year ago quarter it's not an enormous number in terms of the market value of Berkshire which is 700\\nbillion dollars it's like a you know what 18 billion dollar annual run rate of share buyback but they do reduce the\\noutstanding shares a net reduction of shares down about 1.2 percent uh year over year so you know there were\\nquestions that came in that I've been looking through shareholder questions for a couple of months now that have been coming in on this and some of the\\nquestions that came in is do you still like Berkshire Hathaway do you still like the stock at this price are you\\ngoing to be as aggressive as a buyer and I guess this answers some of that question some of it yeah it's it's absolutely not super aggressive uh but\\nit's it's it's sort of soaking up some of the shares that are out there and of course Buffett in his shareholder letter\\nwas very vociferous about defending the practice of of being able to buy back\\nstocks so he does it in a disciplined way he wants to be careful about why he's doing it and what the valuation is\\nbut uh clearly he's willing to use that tool oh the cash went up to 130 billion\\ndollars so up marginally total cash holder nice Pocket Change um there had been a lot of questions\\nthat came into about the insurance company specifically Geico and you can see the gecko right now that's right shoulder uh people just wondering um\\nwhat's happening and I guess we'll dig into that a little deeper today and we've got some numbers that you've been going through be very interested to hear\\nthe color on the strategy behind it because there was a little bit of uh you know an issue last year where it seemed\\nlike profitability was done now pricing is up across the industry yeah so policies are able to be written at\\nhigher prices and so that's happening across the board but it does seem you know as I say in the commentary within the the 10q that they did reduce\\nadvertising expense and it was a big swing to the upside and underwriting earnings I mean with insurance it takes\\na while to raise pricing for anybody in the industry because you have to go state by state and get Regulators approvals before approvals before you\\ncan actually raise any of it so there is a delay we saw some a huge hit to the profitability of all the insurers as you\\nknow prices to replace cars prices to fix things construction all of that went up right and they couldn't raise their prices as quickly exactly so it is an\\nindustry-wide phenomena but it seems as if uh Geico is trying to decide they want to skew toward more profitable\\ncustomers we'll see if that's a theme that's going to continue another couple of tidbits are building products and\\nconsumers margin squeeze that's happening across the industry railroads pretty flat okay the BNSF pretty flat\\nyear over year and a pretty big reduction in consumer related Freight uh loading who needs an analyst you've\\nalready done all the work wow did the highlights I got my little you know tape bookmarks yeah that's good it works okay\\nwe have a lot more to get to this morning we want to give you a quick look at today's schedule though Mike and I are going to be here with you until 10\\n15 a.m eastern time that is when Buffett Munger and the vice chairman Greg Abel and Ajit Jane are going to be taking the\\nstage you get to watch all of this the annual meeting you can see it exclusively here on CNBC and cnbc.com\\nBuffett's going to begin the meeting with the summary of the past quarters results but like we said Mike's already\\ndone that for you so that's your bathroom break time then he's going to open the stage to shareholder questions\\nand I'll be asking some that have been emailed into me again we've gotten lots and lots of emails this year more than\\nI've ever seen Buffett's also going to rotate through the 11 microphone microphone positions that are in the\\naudience too so you'll see a lot of questions being asked around 1pm Buffett will break for lunch but you get to\\nstick around with us Mike and I will be joined right here by Berkshire board members Ron Olson and Howard Buffett we'll also be talking to Tech investor\\nAnn widblad and Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby kodek who has been coming to this meeting for years he was here last year\\nbut had to leave early because he was going to a birthday party so he left I think at the lunch break after that is\\nwhen Buffett revealed to the crowd that he had taken a stake in Activision Blizzard so Bobby found out when he was\\non a plane on his way back home so he's here this year too and we'll find out if there's any new news on that at the time\\nof course it was viewed as an Arbitrage position because Activision agreed to be sold to Microsoft for cash and Buffett\\nsaid it was an Arbitrage position yeah exactly the spread was very wide it seemed just like the market was leaving money on the table now that it looks\\nlike perhaps Regulators in the UK might block that deal the question is does it remain you know on a fundamental basis\\nyeah that would be fascinating to hear the commentary on that and then at 2 p.m Eastern Buffett and Munger will be back\\non stage for another two and a half hours of shareholder q a after the afternoon session wraps we'll be back\\nwith you to recap all of the day's action while the Market's staging a big rally\\nto close the week after a strong job support and revisions to the February and March employment numbers Apple a\\nmajor Berkshire holding which was unchanged in the quarter a key driver for yesterday's rally the stock closing\\nHigher by about four and a half percent uh on the day after posting better than expected earnings Apple now up nearly 34\\npercent so far this year here to help us navigate the current market environment and look at opportunities right now as\\nJohn Rogers he's the chairman and co-ceo of aerial Investments and a long time Berkshire meeting attendee John good to\\nsee you thanks for stopping by here great to be here um what's your uh I guess what you what are you looking to hear from Mr Buffett\\nand Munger uh both about I mean we know that the principles are going to accentuate that they always do about how\\nthey do their business and and what matters and doesn't matter in the uh in the earnings and how they approach things but what about the moment right\\nnow where it seems like there's big big questions about financial system stability whether there's value in in\\nBank stocks whether the economy can handle these rate hikes a couple things that I'm going to be looking for one you\\nknow when Becky interviewed Warren when he was in Asia and there was talk and Warren talked about how certain of his\\ncompanies were not meeting expectations earnings were going to be less than expected and profits were lower than expected and so I want to see if that\\ntrend has continued are is he still seeing weakness in the overall economy and the second thing you know Becky\\nfollowed up the question about Paramount Global and he was kind of a little bit soft and not as aggressively supporting\\nhis position as I had expected so I'm curious to see what he has to say today about it especially after the stock just\\nlocated this week and you are an owner of Paramount correct we are an owner of Paramount Global assist it's not been a\\nfun week yeah how do you feel about things I mean Paramount slashing the dividend um I I think it caught some people by\\nsurprise but Mario gabelli was here yesterday and he said it didn't catch him by surprise he wanted them to do that because he wanted them to shore up\\ntheir cast position and put it back into their business at this point but I think it was the right decision and I watched\\nMario yesterday morning and then we did a panel and he has been very positive about the future\\nfor Paramount Global so we're still very very optimistic we think they have so many assets around the world they've got\\nthat great Paramount Library they've got Mission Impossible coming out this year all the great Sports entertainment that\\nthey have and all-time favorites like 60 minutes so I think there's more there than just the streaming and I think\\nsometimes people are more worried than they need to be is it more there as a standalone business or do you think that this is an acquisition an acquisition\\nTarget and that I mean Mario belly has always been about you know business of Love Making with mergers and\\nacquisitions you're right I think that everyone as we talk to experts in in the industry everyone says there's way too many\\nstreaming services we've got to get it down to three four at the maximum so I think it's very possible that Paramount\\nGlobal will be bought at some point as a value manager do you look at the Carnage\\nin things like Regional Banks and anything that seems like it's it's connected to a commercial real estate and view that as uh more of a core risk\\nto the economic Outlook or is there actual value being being surfaced in the process well I think the stocks have\\ngotten crushed there's a lot of pessimism and Warren often says you want to be greedy when others are fearful so I think if you're going to buy the\\nbanking stocks you'd buy a whole basket of them not try to pick one but really be Diversified we've been also adding to\\nour favorite Northern Trust is our favorite Bank stock so I I think we're going to be okay uh it's going to be\\nsome pain and anguish here and of course commercial real estate is getting harmed and it doesn't help having the banks and\\nthe problems they are but yeah down the road we'll be fine I've been talking to folks who here in the last day and there is a little bit of suspense as to\\nwhether in fact clearly we'll get some questions on this whether uh Buffett himself sees there to be any\\nopportunities here to provide capital in areas where it's like I mean it's worth going back to how he acquired a lot of\\nhis financial positions right American Express 60 years ago coming off a crisis that he needed Capital Bank of America\\nclearly Solomon Brothers in the early 90s uh Goldman Sachs back around the crisis too so in other words he's been\\nthere as a source of stable Capital at times when the financial system seemed like it was in trouble would you want to\\nsee him make a move like that that would bring a lot of confidence to the economy and to the financial system whenever he\\nsteps up all of us believe in him so much so I think it would be great if he was able to be helpful during this\\nperiod and get a great return for Berkshire shareholders\\ninvolved with conversations on these things are there deals that he saw and passed up on you know maybe we'll get a\\nlittle color into some of that today I'm hoping that you know maybe that's why there's so many people that are here\\ntoday too John we're going to welcome our television audience in in just a second but we want you to stay with us\\nand I'm doing this because literally the TV clicked so I'm just hold your thought for just a second we want to make sure\\nwe are welcoming our audience in fact you're going to hear a bell in just a second yeah ding ding ding there it goes that\\nsound that you're hearing right now me doing ding ding ding it means that it's 10 a.m eastern time and that means that\\nit is time to welcome our television audience as well we are again at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting and uh\\nyeah okay want to welcome our television audience here and around the world I'm Becky quick I'm here with Mike santoli\\nand this is our live all-day coverage of the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting we are just 15 minutes away from\\nthe start of the action I want to get back to our conversation with John Rogers he's the chairman the co-ceo and\\nthe co and the CIO of aerial Investments and for everybody on television this is a conversation we've been having with\\nour streaming audience at cnbc.com so let's just pick it up with where we left off John you were just talking about how if you saw Buffett step in and do some\\nsort of a deal whether it be in the banking system whether it be something that kind of showed some confidence in\\nthe system that would mean a big deal for investors everywhere I think it would be he is so revered as we know\\naround the world and I know that the by the Administration has been talking with him and I know you know other leaders\\nare and you can bet that he's the First Call of Many of the major banking Giants on Wall Street to make sure they're\\ngetting his best advice and including him in these important conversations it's probably also worth keeping in mind that what he says about his take on\\nwhether in fact the banking system is sound whether whether the market is over\\novershooting and it's uh attack on some of these Regional Bank valuations it's worth listening to as well if he thinks\\nthe FED has it right we have this deposit backstop facility and you know let's keep in mind one of the reasons\\nthat the bank stocks are going down is consumers are in great shape they got a lot of cheap mortgages unprofitable for\\nthe banks they're looking at five percent money market yields they can move their cash there so it's it's it'll\\nbe interesting to hear whether he thinks it's an economic risk or it's just kind of a sector that's upside down for the\\nmoment well as you know he's such a long-term investor and I think he's going to uh you believe as he always\\ntalks about on at the annual meeting about how last century all the problems that confronted our country we always\\nresolve him our capitalist democracy is the best system ever invented so this crisis will pass also I also noticed\\nwhen I love watching CNBC in the morning when you have those special boxes showing returns like now even showing them Regional Banks how they're doing\\nthat's a sign that you're getting toward a period where you know six months from now that'll be a old forgotten story and\\nwe'll be on to something new but I love seeing that because it gives you a sense of what's important today John you our\\nlong-term investor too you're a value investor you don't often get swayed by things that are happening in the\\nimmediate but I have to think that some of the things you've seen recently have been enough to make you sit up and take\\nnotice is there anything you've changed in the portfolio as a result of the potential credit crunch as the result of\\njust watching money move quickly out of places does it change your mind or change your investors thesis at all for\\nthe short term the only thing that sometimes happens like right now the housing the markets have been very weak higher interest rates have been\\nTroublesome and problematic for the Housing Industry so we've been leaning in in some of the suppliers to the\\nHousing Industry some of our favorites like Leslie's pools for example and residio and people that are creating\\nproducts for the Housing Industry we think it's been overdone and there's real Bargains there you know there's been a lot of commentary and to some\\ndegree a bit of angst about how uh narrow the index performance has been at\\nleast recently for times this year we talked about Apple's performance a huge sway on the index is a handful of stocks\\nreally carrying the S P 500 where does that leave you as somebody who looks you know for smaller and and less expensive\\nless popular stocks at the moment you know you know I've been fishing in the small and mid-cap Value World for 40\\nyears and I really think there's more opportunity than ever there's these orphan stocks neglected stocks and no\\none's looking at because they've been so focused on these giant great giant companies that have done so well\\nwhat about Berkshire itself in terms of How It's positioned I mean on the one hand it's kind of Eternal right the way\\nit's structured and who it's managed by but on the other I mean if you look at what's in favor right now you know aside\\nfrom Apple which is you know 20 of the market value of Berkshire right now uh it's taken it is uh you have you know\\nConsumer Staples exposure you have real Capital assets that people seem to be wanting to have pricing power\\num and even on the insurance side they're able to actually make a profit interest rates being up perhaps a help to them do you see value in the shares\\nthemselves at this level we do you know when Warren makes the decision to buy back stock the way he has he's so\\nconservative and so for him to make that bet it gives you a really great sense that he sees the company as really\\nundervalued and we would agree we think it's a great bargain here today do you have you been buying I own it\\npersonally and I was too big for my small and mid cap value uh portfolios at aerial fund but uh I haven't added to it\\nin a while but that's a good suggestion John thank you very much we always enjoy\\nseeing you here and we really appreciate your time this morning John Rogers from aerial Investments\\nall right Berkshire Hathaways 11.6 billion dollar acquisition a year ago of the property and casually ensure\\nAllegheny brought another diverse portfolio of Brands Under The Berkshire umbrella including one of the fastest\\ngrowing toy makers in the U.S that's Jazz Wares they make all those viral squishmallows and here at the meeting\\nthey're actually selling special Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger squish millos this weekend they come in eight inch\\nsize and 16 inch versions this is the first time they've ever made squishmallows with a real human space on\\nthem we actually caught up with the company CEO and chief commercial officer Judd and Laura zaberski\\nwe acquired a company called kelly toys okay and they were making squish Mallows it's been around since 2017 and we were\\nfortunate enough to build the brand once we acquired Kelly toys because the I mean people compare this to things like\\nbeanie babies or to the Cabbage Patch Kids where each of these dolls has a story that comes with it\\num and you guys are holding the special ones you have for this meeting of Warren and Charlie the first time you've ever\\nput a human face on one of this yeah that's the first time so what they worked out pretty good okay but the story lines was that part of it too or\\ndid you guys add to that yeah so every squishmallow has their own individual story and when we acquired Kelly toy we\\nsaw that they had this almost diamond in the rough they were people were passionate about it it wasn't available\\neverywhere it wasn't available globally and then um the BIOS were always part of it and\\nwhat made them really special because kids and adults all identified with something in the bio and so Charlie and\\nWarren both got their own bio that represented them as people not just business people but the really\\ninteresting individuals they are one of the things that I think is so amazing I mean these are cool plush toys but\\nthey're plush toys they're squishy they have become the most popular toy brand in 21 states they beat out Nerf Plato\\nthey beat out Nintendo switch and Hot Wheels how does that happen with the plush and have you guys been surprised\\nby how they've taken off of course yes it struck a nerve during covet um it was\\nthis palliative type of feel so people that were sitting at home they bought more and more squish mouths and they\\nfell in love with the product we're the number one best-selling toy in the US and in many many markets and I think\\nwhat's interesting about it is our demographic it's not just kids it's adults it's grown women it we did a\\nsquish Squad tour and we went to major cities and we looked at the line and we said wow there's not that many children\\nin the line and that's the interesting part people find it emotionally supportive [Music]\\num and that was a big surprise to us yeah people in their 50s are buying our squish Mellows wow that that's very\\nunusual in the greatest and when you found out you were being acquired by Berkshire Hathaway your thought was\\nwow wow and and what's happening uh dream come true yeah if you would have\\nasked us 26 years ago if this would ever ever happen we would say no way but\\nanything's possible in America well the interesting part is Berkshire didn't keep all the companies I think there\\nwere some they kind of got rid of they saw you guys and they chose to keep you which we were you know we I remember\\nlast year we were watching we knew the transaction was happening we watched the\\nannual shareholders meeting and we said are we going to be there next year\\nwell in fact um I think they probably are going to be here next year I think the question is how much of the floor space they're\\ngoing to get to negotiate because those have been hot cells yeah they do um we weren't the only ones who caught\\nup with them though we were actually there a little later when Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger came by to visit the Jazz Wares Booth right here in the\\nexhibition Hall and here's a funny coincidence for you both of them both Laura and Judd were lawyers before they\\nhad this career that's something they had in common with Charlie Munger too and by the way\\num they were sick of it too they wanted a job that was a little more fun\\ndid you know they're both reformed lawyers yes they both started out as lawyers well I'm ready to see a reform\\nlawyer every time\\ngoing through purchase orders yes Charlie I would like to see about 90 of\\nthe lawyers being reported this is a pinch me moment for us because we remember you know Judd started the\\ncompany by himself no financing no money no backing and just did it and worked\\nhard and of course we had many bumps in the road many many and it makes it that\\nmuch sweeter and we appreciate it and we never forget how hard it was and we're much smarter today than we were\\nyesterday I learned a lot I'm glad you were part of alligators\\nyou can catch more of our interview with Judd and Laura zaberski of jazz Wares and some other sounds from inside the\\nBerkshire Hathaway annual meeting in a special series of cnbc's daily podcast it's called squawk pod and you can just\\nscan the QR code on your screen to go ahead and follow squawkpod you can check it out and listen anytime\\nall right well joining us now is the CEO of Benjamin Moore Dan Calkins Benjamin Moore has been part of the Berkshire\\nportfolio for more than 20 years Dan uh good to have you great to be back I hope\\nyou're enjoying the weekend so far um eventful few years since you've been running the business yes uh for\\nBerkshire for at Benjamin Moore uh housing boom in conjunction with the pandemic then a little a downturn in in\\nhome related investment uh and Improvement where do things stand right now we got the inflationary pressures\\nyou've had to kind of deal with and and pass through so what's your kind of snapshot of the business right now well\\nwe're in a great spot we're actually celebrating our 140th anniversary this year at Benjamin Moore so we've been\\nthrough Cycles like this before obviously we'll be through this cycle but it has been uh what we call Benjamin\\nMoore Chasing The New Normal because we had explosive growth in 20 and 21 took a\\nlittle bit of a step back in the fourth quarter last year got off to a slow start this year but at the end of March\\nwe start to see light we're going into the paint season and people people are seeing starting to paint again and we're\\nseeing that in our numbers on a regular basis obviously Big Driver for us is housing turnover and with interest rates\\nHigh people not moving as much that has an impact on our business so as as mortgage rates hopefully start to come\\ndown we'll see more active moving and that drives to more sales for us and and just fixing things up when you cut a\\npaint we can't or we can't move so yeah exactly yeah you'll have people doing some remodeling if they're not going anywhere but the Big Driver is the churn\\nsomebody moves they pay every room every room and in terms of supply chain I mean\\nPaint and Coatings were particularly dramatically impacted yes you know during the the pandemic with a lot of\\nthe components there short supply where does it sit right now and if you retain pricing I was just looking in aggregate\\nin the in the quarterly report that you know there has been some margins Queens across the building products uh\\nbusinesses in total which is not suspicious right no we we definitely felt that we're in a good spot now\\num early last year we had about 65 days of inventory on end our historical average is about 95 days on hand I'm\\nhappy to say at the end of March we're at 96 days on hand so we're back to our historical Norms from an inventory\\nperspective we have been able to take pricing over both 21 and 22. so uh while\\nwe've felt some of the pressure and compression last year that's evening out now we're recognizing the pricing we\\ntook last year in our sales this year so things are good and so that implies that you haven't seen consumers sort of trading down or\\nanything like that when it comes to pain yeah no we have we have some particularly on the DIY side we've seen\\nsome of our product mix shift from some of our more premium products to more of our mid-range products uh but we have a\\nfull assortment full of portfolio that can meet all those price points that are out there and so we're we're seeing some\\nof that happening right now and with margin shrinks when somebody trades down how much does it's maybe six seven\\npoints on from a you know premium product to more of a commercial type product but we have healthy margins at\\nBenjamin Moore we have one of the things Warren life's best about Benjamin Moore is that premium position we carry you\\nknow there there's a big picture uh sort of long-term structural bullish story about home ownership actually\\nhomeownership rates uh ticking higher still even through this tough period of the economy and this demographic wave\\nthat's washing over but how are you thinking about you know expansion plans your ability to capture a lot of that\\nyeah so we have been growing and expanding banding not just here in North America we've been very aggressive\\nparticularly in the UK and then moving into Western Europe which is still a small part of our business but we\\nhaven't felt the impact over there because it's New Territory for us so we have explosive growth going on over\\nthere right now um very exciting and then here long term you know you to your point about families being formed that's\\nhappening with this generation that's coming into the housing market and we just think this is a blip through this period of time and as that changes we're\\nprepared to to service what we need to guys if you take a look you'll see this is live footage Warren Buffett is making\\nhis way out to the stage right now Charlie Munger will be joining him as well that means they're getting about to\\nthe end of the movie they have a long movie 45 minute movie that they show to the shareholders that's what they're\\nseeing right now and there you see Charlie Munger as well so they're being taken out the stage that means things are about to kick off there so I'm going\\nto take my lead that also means you need you have a place to go okay Mike thank you I'll see you back in just a little\\nbit thanks so much thank you all right\\nwell Insurance of course one of the big story lines in berkshire's earnings this morning joining me now to discuss is\\nevercore's David modematan he has got a buy rating by ratings on the likes of\\nTravelers Progressive and Chubb uh uh from evercore isi and uh and Dave thanks\\nfor joining us uh this morning we were just talking about how over the first quarter berkshire's Insurance businesses\\nspecifically Geico did make some moves on pricing uh kind of fattened up the margins reducing advertising spend uh it\\nseems like maybe an industry-wide Trend but what's been happening overall in the competitive uh landscape when it comes\\nto those Insurance lines yeah thanks for having me um so you are seeing just a massive hard\\nMarket in the personal auto insurance space and Geico has actually taken you\\nknow fairly aggressive action on that front um and you can see that you know the focus on profitability is really\\ncoming through in in these results where their policies enforce shrank 13 and you\\nknow that's partly because you know there are premium per policy which is a good proxy for their price increases you\\nknow is up 15 uh which is you know among the highest that I've seen you know\\nAllstate was up 16 Progressive was up you know close to that level so the entire industry is Raising price\\num for guy for Geico it looks like they've actually seen you know the their\\nunits come down quite a bit and that's resulted in them having better frequency Dynamics which is you know really help\\ntheir earnings and you know another thing I've noticed is um you know they really cut their ad spend to really\\nfocusing on you know what what people they're underwriting to focus on profitability\\nI appreciate that color uh David that was uh that's great we're going to hear a lot more about that in the Q a in the\\nshareholder meeting and we're going to actually get to Becky and Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger for Q a we'll see you\\nback here at 1pm Eastern time when Buffett and Munger break for lunch ahead of their afternoon q a session and the\\nofficial shareholder meeting they are taking the stage uh right now as you can see and we go there live morning good\\nmorning and thanks for coming I love it Charlie loves it we're glad to\\nhave you here we're going to make this this uh\\npreliminary before the question is very short because we want to get in at least\\n60 Questions half divided by the the audience outside this\\nArena and half from you so I would just\\nlike to get right to the to the directors and the earnings that\\nhave been put up on the uh on our webpage this morning but we'll\\ncover those very fast and we'll get to the questions now I\\nwhen I woke up this morning I realized that\\nwe had a competitive broadcast going out\\nuh somewhere in the UK and and\\nthey were they were celebrating a King Charles and we've got our own\\nKing Charles here today [Applause]\\nand next to him we have Greg Abel we was in charge of all the\\noperations except for insurance next\\n[Applause] [Music] [Applause]\\nand next to Greg we have uh a man I ran into a 1986 and\\nhas made us look good ever since we have the man in charge of insurance Ajit Jane Jaden\\nand now we have our our directors here in front and if they would just stand briefly and then I'll go on\\nto the next one and and uh they're all here today first of all\\ndoing alphabetically there's Howard Buffett\\nthere's Suzy Buffett\\nthere's Steve Burke\\nKen Chenal\\nChris Davis\\nSue Decker Charlotte Diamond\\nTom Murphy Jr Ron Olsen\\nWally Weiss and Merle Whitburn\\nthat's as good as you can get and there's one other person I would like to mention before we\\nget onto the earnings that were put on the uh in the press release this morning and\\nuh uh that's uh uh\\nwell let's see who we have here we've got this is hard to believe\\ncan you imagine a name Melissa Shapiro Shapiro\\nand she was uh Melissa Shapiro Joseph married another Shapiro and she put this\\nwhole thing together with no help from me no help from Charlie and a lot of\\nhelp from the people of the other room Melissa\\nyeah it's very easy if you can remember her second name you can remember her third name so Melissa shabiro Shapiro\\nand with that I would like to next move on to the\\nearnings and a couple small slides that that explain what\\nwe're all about and then we're going to get to the Q a and uh the slide is up behind me yeah there it\\nis we reported in the first quarter\\noperating earnings a little over 8 billion and when we talk about operating\\nearnings we're basically referring to the earnings\\nof Berkshire Hathaway as generally well as required under gaap excluding however\\ncapital gains both realized and unrealized there's a few other very minor items but basically\\nwe expect to make capital gains over time why would we own the stocks otherwise uh doesn't always work out but\\noverall it works out pretty well over time but in any day any quarter any year\\neven occasionally over a five-year period uh the stock prices move around\\ncapriciously now we own a lot of other businesses we consider those stocks businesses we own a lot of other\\nbusinesses where they get Consolidated and they don't move around in value now if we had a little bit of Burlington\\nstock outstanding if we had a little bit of the energy stock trading those stocks\\nwould move around a lot but the businesses are what count so the\\noperating earnings as you'll see in the first quarter came in at about 8 billion\\nand I would say that in the general economy\\nthe feedback we get is that uh I would say perhaps the majority of our\\nbusinesses will actually report lower earnings this year\\nthan last year the in various degrees in the last six months or so at various times\\nuh the the businesses have left the incredible\\nperiod which is about as extraordinaries I've seen in business since World War II\\nuh with the government would pour out a lot of money to people who couldn't get\\nGoods it was more extreme in World War II but this was extreme this time and it was just a question\\nof getting Goods the deliverer and people bought and they didn't wait for sales and if\\nyou couldn't sell them one thing they would put another thing in their backlog it was an extraordinary period and that\\nperiod uh has ended it hasn't ended with as you\\nknow it isn't that employment's fault or off a cliff or anything in the least but\\nbut uh it is a different climate than it was six months ago and and a\\nnumber of our managers uh were surprised some of them had too much inventory on order and then all of\\na sudden it got delivered and people weren't in the same frame of mind as earlier\\nand now we'll start having sales at places where we didn't need to have sales before but\\nuh despite the fact that this year I think in general will\\nbe slower than last year we actually are\\nsituated so that I would expect and believe me when I say accept expect\\nit's nothing is sure nothing sure tomorrow nothing sure next year and nothing is\\never sure either in markets or in business forecasts or anything else and we don't\\npay much attention to markets or forecasts unless the markets happen to offer something interesting to do but\\nnevertheless we are positioned in two respects as you'll see from from this uh first report our investment\\nincome is going to be a lot larger uh this year than last year and that's\\nthat's built in I mean we have as you'll see in a minute we've had 125\\nbillion or so and very short term investments and\\nand believe it or not uh not that long ago\\nwe were getting four basis points which is next to nothing\\non that 100 125 billion which means we were getting 50 million a year\\nand now the same money the other just day or day before yesterday we\\nactually bought because of some of the funny twist in the market because of doubts about the\\ndeficit ceiling of the debt ceiling uh we bought three billion of bills of the\\n590 that's 5.9 there's a 5.92 bond\\nequivalent yield so we will have what produced us not that\\nlong ago on a 12-month basis was producing 50 million a year producing uh something in the area of 5 billion\\nhere so we're in a position where the investment income is essentially well it\\nis certain to increase quite a bit and insurance underwriting\\nis not it uh it does not correlate\\nwith business activity it depends on things like hurricanes and earthquakes\\nand and other events so on a prospective basis on a probability\\nbasis we're likely to have a a better year\\nuh this year in Insurance underwriting than we had last year uh it just isn't\\naffected by what you might call the business cycle or uh what applies to generally an\\nindustry detailing you name it uh so I would expect\\nand one massive earthquake or one one hurricane that came into just\\nthe wrong place uh would can affect that prediction but on a\\nprobabilistic basis our insurance looks better this year so if you get two of those\\ntwo of the elements there of our main office of earnings that look like they\\nwill swing in our Direction I would expect but I can't promise that our operating and earnings will be\\ngreater than last year and if we'll move to\\nthe second slide uh I give you those operating earnings\\nfigures just to give you a overview of what has happened\\nuh since the pandemic started and off of the year\\nthe yearbook before as a base and we retain all our earnings as you know\\nso if we're retaining 30 or 35 billion or whatever but maybe a year you should\\nexpect more operating earnings over time I mean this this number should be\\nsignificantly higher five or ten or fifteen years from now because we have the advantage of retaining earnings and\\nthat's what got us to these figures because they were essentially nothing when we started and they got there by\\nretaining earnings and we'll keep retaining earnings so it's no great Triumph if these numbers move up and\\nwhat we hope is that they move up at a reasonable rate historically\\nthey moved up at an unreasonable rate sometimes but we're working with a much smaller sums then and that can't be\\nrepeated with our present Capital base because I note there I believe it's on this slide let's take\\na look uh now that'll be\\nsee it's on the while on the on the next on the next\\nplace paid and let's move to the next slide we showed that we had on March 31st\\nnow 500 and was it five hundred and four billion\\nof Gap net worth now what might surprise you\\nis that there's no other company in the United States no other company that has a number\\nthat is that large now that isn't because we've got the most valuable\\ncompany in the United States other companies have used their money to repurchase\\nshares they could have accumulated 504 billion in gap but basically we have more\\nunder Gap accounting now than any other company in the U.S and of course if you\\nmeasure return on on Equity that becomes a very big number to increase\\nat a rapid rate but we hope to do so uh not a rapid rate additional rate\\num and right below that you see something called float\\nand float is money that uh is left in our hands\\nuh somewhat Akin but very importantly different\\nthan a bank deposit but it uh you have to pay interest to get a bank deposit and you have to pay more\\ninterest these days and you have to run a bank and do a lot of things and basically this is money that represents\\nunpaid losses at this time you get paid in advance in insurance so what shows up\\nas a net liability on our balance sheet is gives us funds uh\\ndo exercise with an amount of discretion that no other insurance company that I know of in the\\nworld enjoys just because we have so much net worth and our float now\\ncomes to 165 billion and the man sitting on the far left is\\nresponsible for moving that number up from a pittance in 1986\\nto this incredible figure which in most years practically all years\\nhasn't cost us anything so it's like having a bank with no employees no\\ninterest and no ability to withdraw the money in\\na hurry that we have working for us and it's a\\nvery valuable asset that uh that shows up as a liability and uh\\nAjit is responsible for building up this\\ntreasure uh which has done been done by out competing insurance companies all over\\nthe world and then now a number of our insurance companies in turn are run by talented managers\\nwho contributed one way or another uh start with Geico\\nthe beginning of my career and the uh that float if you think about it just\\nthink of a balance sheet you've got liabilities here and you got assets over here and and the liability side finances\\nthe asset side is very simple and stockholders Equity finances it\\nlong-term debt finances and so on but stockholders Equity is very expensive in\\na real sense long-term debt has been cheap for a while but it can get expensive and it\\ncan also become new eventually and it and it may not be available\\nuh but float is another item which shows it's a\\nliability but hasn't cost us anything and it it can't disappear in a hurry and\\nit finances the asset side in the same way a stockholders equity\\nand nobody else thinks of it much that way but but we've always thought of it that way and it's built up over time so\\nuh I show at the bottom what's happened with cash and treasury bills\\nthrough March 31st and I will tell you that the in the month of April\\nwe probably added about seven billion dollars to that\\nfactor now part of that is because we didn't buy as much stock because that reduces reduces cash and treasury bills\\nwe bought about 400 million dollars worth of stock in the month of April that's that's a minus uh in terms of\\ncash available and uh uh we we however sold not some stock\\nwhich produced maybe four billion and of course we had operating earnings probably two and a half\\nbillion or something in that area and my guess is we've probably increased our cash and treasury bills uh six and seven\\nbillion in the month and uh I just want to give you a feel for how the cash\\nflows at Berkshire and then if we move to the final I think it's the final one next to the last one uh\\nno I I think it is a lot let's see it's the fourth yeah is this we should have the one up\\nthere class a equivalent shares outstanding and and uh you'll notice that every year\\nthe number of our shares go down so if we own more businesses and the businesses make more money\\nyour chair as shareholders as owners a Berkshire increases every year without\\nyou laying out any money now you're laying out the uh the\\nalternative which you could receive in dividends but the reason we've gotten to\\nwhere we are is because we we kept the money we did pay a dividend\\nin 19. 67 10 cents to share it was a terrible mistake and uh I\\nI always tell people that I I'd love for the men's room and the directors voted while he's gone but that isn't true I\\nwas there I confessed they uh but we're very invested and has produced the\\n500 billion plus of shareholders equity in the 30 billion plus of operating\\nearnings and and we'll continue to follow that policy because it makes a great deal of sense and uh\\nwith that I think we've taken care of the preliminaries you can study that\\nthe 10q is is on the uh on the uh web page and if you have a\\nweek or two vacation you could spend it reading the 10q and but that is the\\nessence of Berkshire and with that I will start with Becky quick and and uh we\\nwill alternate between Becky and and the audience and her questions have come in\\nfrom all over the country and I believe you identified the sender and go to it Becky thanks Warren the first question\\ncomes in from Randy Jeffs in Irvine California and his question is if Silicon Valley Bank's deposit had not\\nbeen fully covered what do you think the economic consequences would have been to the nation\\nsimply say it would have been catastrophic and that's why they were covered uh and\\neven though the FDIC limiters two hundred and fifty thousand dollars that that's the way the statute reads\\nbut that is not the way the us is going to behave uh any more than they're going to let\\nthe debt ceiling uh uh cause the world to go into turmoil and uh they\\nuh well they're just I can't imagine\\nanybody in the administration and the Congress and the Federal Reserve whatever it may\\nhave been FDIC I can't imagine anybody's saying uh I'd like to be the one on\\ntelevision tomorrow and explain the American public why we're keeping uh\\nuh only two hundred and fifty thousand dollars insured and we're gonna start around every Bank in the country and\\ndisrupt the world financial system uh so uh I think it was inevitable Charlie The\\nAmity no I have nothing to add\\napparently I should mention this now ajeet and Greg will be here in the\\nmorning session which ends at noon and so uh it's got questions to direct to\\nthem the time to do it is in the first half of the show and and then after lunch\\nthat'll just Charlie and I will be back okay\\narea one hi nirav Patel Haverhill Massachusetts\\nMr Buffett Mr Monger it seems like you found the Sweet Spot between being too\\nconservative and too aggressive as investors do you ever make bad investment\\ndecisions because of your emotions and what do you do to try to keep that from\\nhappening well we make\\nbad investment decisions uh plenty of times I make more than Charlie\\nbecause I'm I like to think it's because I make more decisions but probably more batting average is worse but\\nI can't recall anytime\\nin the history of Berkshire the women in an emotional decision that\\nI know the movie had Jamie Lee in there but that that was for Laughs\\nI mean Jamie Jamie Lee she's good but she's not\\ngood enough to get me or Charlie to make an emotional decision\\nlaughs Charlie\\nI'm sure you have something to add on that\\nwell it's a different movie than it is shown in most corporate meetings [Laughter]\\npersonal decision no I don't know that's in business we're talking about\\nyeah no you don't want to be a no emotion person in all of your life but you you definitely want to be a no more\\nno emotion person to making an investment or business decision that uh you can argue that that uh uh\\nwith it we probably I would say that we\\n've made an emotional decision perhaps and when a manager has been with us for\\nsome period and we haven't we've\\nwe we've ignored the fact that perhaps they weren't quite what\\nthey were earlier but our businesses are so good that they they've run better sometimes\\nuh when uh well I've talked about\\nWest Coast for example the wonderful Louisville it ran on\\nit ran on automatic pilot for a while but I don't think we suffered to buy it but you can argue\\nthat if Charlie and I hadn't liked Louie as much as we did we might have spotted\\na little bit early but I don't think it made any difference in the results would you would you agree with that Charlie\\nyeah yeah we totally with it and\\nI'm glad we behaved the way we did it Wesco by the way we bought the thing for\\na few tens of millions and it became worth two or three billion\\nyeah that wasn't common in the Savings and Loan businesses you may have noticed they want they really went crazy in that\\nindustry and and we had a wonderful guy in Louis and we didn't go crazy yeah we didn't go crazy\\ndumb okay Becky\\nthis question comes from Ben Knoll in Minneapolis he says he's a Berkshire shareholder of three decades and he's\\nattended many Berkshire meetings he's here again this year and this is addressed to Ajit and Greg he says last\\nyear I asked you about how Geico and BNSF appeared to lose ground to their leading competitors Geico on telematics\\nand BNSF on Precision scheduled railroading Ajit you responded by saying how you expected Geico to make progress\\nin a year or two Greg you spoke about your pride in BNSF but you didn't directly address the threat of precision\\nscheduled railroading will each of you please provide perspective on these competitive challenges and our company's\\nstrategies to address them let me\\nin terms of Geico and telematics let me make the observation that Geico has\\ncertainly taken the ball by the horns and has made rapid strides in terms of trying to bridge the gap\\nin terms of telematics and its competitors they have now reached a point where on\\nall new business close to 90 percent is has a telematics input to to the\\npricing decision unfortunately less than half of that is being taken up by the policyholders the\\nother point I want to make is even though we have made improvements in in terms of Bridging the Gap on telematics\\nwe still haven't started to realize the true benefit and the real culprit or the\\nbottleneck is technology Geico's technology needs a lot more work than I thought it did\\nit has more than 500 actually more than 600 Legacy systems that don't really talk to each other and we're trying to\\ncompress them to no more than 15 16 systems that all talk to each other\\nthat's a Monumental Challenge and because of that even though we have made improvements in telematics we still have\\na long way to go because of Technology [Music]\\nbecause of that and because of the whole issue more broadly in terms of matching rate to risk Geico is still work in\\nprogress I don't know if you any of you had a chance to look at the first quarter results but Geico has had a very\\ngood first quarter coming in at a combined ratio of 93 and change which means a margin of six and change\\nuh even though that's very good it's not something we can take to the bank because they're two unusual items that\\ncontributed to it firstly we've had what is called prior year Reserve releases\\nwe've reduced results for the previous years and that contributed to it and secondly every year the first quarter\\ntends to be a seasonally good quote of auto insurance writers\\nso if you just for those two factors my guess is the end of the year Geico will end up with a combined ratio just south\\nof 100 as opposed to the Target they're shooting for 96.\\nI hope they reached the target of 96 by the end of next year\\nand but instead of getting too excited about it I think it's important to realize that even if we reach 96 it will\\ncome at the expense of having lost policy holder there is a trade-off between\\nprofitability and growth and clearly we have we're going to emphasize\\nprofitability and not growth and that will come at the expense of policyholder so it will not be until two years from\\nnow that we'll be back on track fighting the battles on both the profitability and growth front\\nGreg yep moving to BNSF\\nI'll start again by expressing great pride in the BNSF team we have an exceptional group of led by Katie and\\nand her managers that uh show up every day to do great work on on the railroad\\nat the same time they would be the first to acknowledge there's more to be done there uh the specific reference to\\nPrecision scheduled railroading the other large railroad Class A uh\\nrailroads in the in the U.S follow that and including the two in Canada we're\\nwell aware of what they're doing and and obviously pay close attention to their\\noperating Matrix and our team strives every day to be more efficient obviously I would say we balance it with the needs\\nof our customers if I look back to pre-2022 so we look at the three-year\\nperiod of 2019 2020 2021 the BNSF team\\nmade significant progress on their efficiencies and and and delivering\\noverall value back to the shareholders and and to their customers and at the same time maintaining a very safe\\nrailroad for our employees so we're making excellent progress that didn't stop last year they made great progress\\nagain the reality in 2022 as we did go through a period of time where we had to\\ncall it reset the railroad we came out of the pandemic there were the supply challenges we had certain other issue\\nlabor issues and other things going on at the port and the reality is our team prioritized getting the railroad back in\\nplace for the long term not a short-term focus on hitting certain operating metrics in in\\n2022 we're well aware of where we were relative to those metrics but the real Focus was to get the railroad reset in a\\nin a safe manner such that we could deliver long-term value and long-term service to our customers and and that's\\nreally what we'll continue to see with that team they'll be continual progress there'll be years where it's not as\\nquickly or even we go backwards but over the long term we'll be very uh we'll see\\nexceptional results from from that team and and couldn't be more proud that we have that asset thank you\\nI wouldn't I would just [Applause] well he deserves but both of them\\ndeserve Applause the I would like to add one thing [Applause]\\n[Music] [Applause] the\\nuh at Geico .com's uh\\nwas ajith's Choice my choice go back to guy at Geico\\nto work on the problem of matching rate to risk which is what\\ninsurance is all about and uh he arrived\\nwith exquisite timing right before the pandemic broke out all kinds of things changed but Todd is\\ndoing a wonderful job at Geico and uh and he\\nworks closely uh with the Jeep but because he saw his home and all Morgan comes back\\nhere and we we get together on the weekend sometimes too so uh uh that's been a\\na remarkable com accomplishment under difficult circumstances and he's not all the way home but he's a he's made a very\\nvery big change uh in multiple ways Geico and then one\\nother thing I would like to mention there have been a lot of public companies created in the last decade\\nthereabouts in insurance and uh there's none of them\\nthat we would like to own and and they always started out in their perspective saying this is\\na tech company not an insurance company of course we're of course they're in a tech company where everybody's\\nwhether they're in insurance or a lot of other places are using the facility but\\nyou still have to properly match rate to risk and uh uh that they invariably have\\nreported the huge losses they've eaten up capital but there's been one company that nobody\\nhas generally heard of there's only been one that I know of company started in the last 10 years\\nthat has been a overwhelming success and that's a company that a g\\nand four people who join with them set to develop a new business\\nit's called Berkshire Hathaway specialty it now has uh what's the float a g coming up to 12\\nbillion yeah we've we've built more slope than probably all these companies combined\\nwe've now it it's cost us essentially nothing in terms of an underwriting loss\\nthe four people have turned in I don't know 1500 around the world we we took on the whole industry and we brought\\nsome unique how and the four people that came and\\nnow have like I said 1500 or so worldwide and we brought capital and we\\nbrought okay capabilities that really only Berkshire\\ncould Supply so it was the it was the combination of of\\nbrains and talent and energy and money and no one has really successfully\\nentered this this space plenty of people in the space who didn't\\nlike us coming and we did it without it costing us a dime of Entry\\nand it's been unmatched by any of the public companies that went public\\nand people have seen us do it but they can't duplicate it and that's\\nwhat Vegeta's created and Peter Eastwood has led this group Berkshire Hathaway\\nspecially and uh it's just remarkable so anyway with that let's go on yeah give\\nhim a hand for that [Music]\\nokay let's go to section two\\nhi Charlie I'm our end I'm Karen here\\nyour priorities are right yes I have a questions on AI and\\nRobotics here's my questions as Ai and Robotics continue to advance what do you\\nbelieve will be the positive and an active impact of this technology\\non both the stocks markets and society as a whole and are there any specific\\nIndustrials and companies that you believe will be most impacted\\nKaren I thank you for asking Charlie that question\\nwell if you went into byd's factories in\\nChina you would see robotics going in the unbelievable rate\\nso we're gonna see a lot more robotics in the world I am personally\\nskeptical of some of the hype that has gone into artificial intelligence I think old-fashioned intelligence works\\npretty well thank you [Applause]\\nthere won't be a there won't be anything in AI that replaces the gene\\nthe state that unqualifyingly they can do amazing things uh\\nuh you know Bill Gates brought me out of out\\nthe latest maybe not the latest version but when he thought maybe I could handle which that has to be careful with me in\\nterms of leading me too fast uh and it did it did these remarkable things uh it\\ndidn't but it it it couldn't tell jokes well Bill told me that ahead of time and it prepared me and it it just isn't\\nthere but you know with things like checking all the legal opinions on you\\nknow since the beginning of time and everything and eliminating all the\\nsided I mean it can do all kinds of things and when something can do all kinds of\\nthings I get a little bit worried uh and uh because I know we won't be able to\\nuninvent it and uh you know we did invent\\nuh for very very good reason the atom bomb and in World War II and it\\nwas you know it was enormously important that we did so\\nbut is it good for the next 200 years of the world that that the ability to do so has\\nbeen Unleashed we didn't have a choice but uh uh\\nwhen you start something well Einstein said after this has changed everything in the world\\nexcept how men think and uh I would say the same thing May\\nnot not the same thing I don't mean that but I mean they with with AI\\nuh it it can change everything in the world accept it how men think and behave\\nand that's that's a big step to take it's a good question and it's the best\\nanswer we can give Becky this question comes from Tom Seymour he\\nsays the first sentence of a recent Financial Times article read Charlie\\nMunger has warned of a brewing storm in the U.S commercial property Market with American Banks full of what he said were\\nbad loans as property prices fall please elaborate on what's going on in commercial real estate how bad will the\\nlosses be and what sectors or geographies look particularly bad I'll just add an addendum from another viewer\\nwho wrote in and wanted to know if Berkshire would be more active in commercial real estate as a result\\nthank you well berkshire's never been very\\nimportant very active in commercial real estate it it works better for taxable investors\\nthan it does for corporations tax the way Berkshire is so\\nI I don't anticipate huge effects on Berkshire but I do think that\\nthe hollowing out of the downtowns in the United States and elsewhere in the\\nworld is going to be quite significant and quite unpleasant I think the country will get through it\\nall right but as they say it will awfully it will often involve a different set of owners\\nyeah in the buildings the buildings don't go away but the owners do well but\\nbut most people like to buy with non-recourse and and real estate and and\\none time I asked Charlie there was some real estate guy we were talking to him and you know how do they decide how much\\nthey can a building like this is worth and it's the answer is it's whatever they can borrow without signing their\\nname and if you look at real estate generally you'll understand\\nwhat the phenomena is happening if you if you remind yourself that that's the\\nattitude of most people that have uh become big in in the real estate\\nbusiness and and uh and it does mean that the lenders\n",
